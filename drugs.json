  "notes": "25I‑NBOMe is an ultra‑potent 5‑HT2A agonist active at microgram doses; the difference between a strong and dangerous dose can be small, particularly with nasal use or concentrated liquids. Numerous severe toxicities and fatalities have been reported, especially from misidentified blotters and insufflated powders. Reagent testing is essential when a blotter is sold as “LSD”: Ehrlich/Hofmann positive and a lack of rapid, vivid Marquis color change support lysergamide; NBOMes generally show no Ehrlich/Hofmann reaction and often give pronounced Marquis reactions on paper. Taste is not diagnostic, but a strong bitter/metallic taste with oral numbness is commonly reported for NBOMes; treat as a warning and test. Never eyeball powder; prepare measured solutions (volumetric dosing) and label concentrations clearly to avoid accidental overdoses. Because oral (swallowed) bioavailability is unreliable, sublingual/buccal absorption is the typical route; hold for 15–30 minutes before spitting/swallowing. Significant vasoconstriction (cold/numb extremities, cramps, hypertension) and agitation can occur; avoid stimulants, strenuous activity, overheating, and stay hydrated with small sips. In an emergency (seizure, hyperthermia, severe agitation, chest pain, uncontrolled hypertension), seek immediate medical help; clinicians typically use benzodiazepines and supportive care. NBOMes have frequently been laid on blotters resembling LSD; do not assume any blotter is LSD without testing. Strong cross‑tolerance exists with classical psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DOx, 2C‑x), and redosing within days will be less effective yet may increase side‑effects. Legal status: controlled in many jurisdictions (e.g., EU control recommended 2014; US Schedule I since 2016). citeturn8search2turn13search0turn13reddit16turn12search5turn6view0",

  "notes": "3‑MeO‑PCP is active in the single‑milligram range; inaccurate scales can lead to large relative dosing errors, so volumetric dosing is strongly recommended. The dose–response curve is steep and onset can be delayed, making premature redosing a common cause of accidental over-intoxication. It is an NMDA receptor antagonist and has been described by TripSit as also exhibiting mild serotonin reuptake inhibition, so combinations with serotonergic substances warrant extra caution. Compared with ketamine, it can produce clearer stimulation but is also more likely to induce ambulatory delirium, disinhibition, and manic or psychotic states at strong doses. Erowid documents that at least one death has been associated with 3‑MeO‑PCP and warns of episodes where users cannot distinguish fantasy from reality, increasing risk of harm in uncontrolled environments. Avoid mixing with alcohol or benzodiazepines due to unpredictable sedation and accident risk; avoid driving or hazardous activities until the next day because after‑effects can persist up to 48 hours. People with a personal or family history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or mania should avoid due to elevated risk of psychiatric destabilization. The RC market is prone to mislabeling and variable purity; reagent testing and conservative allergy tests reduce risk. Tolerance builds rapidly with frequent use; spacing sessions by multiple weeks reduces both tolerance and compulsive redosing patterns.",

This general ROA principle is reflected across harm-reduction communities and TripSit resources. citeturn14search0 Because validated human pharmacokinetics are lacking, any stated duration and dosing should be treated as uncertain; community posts about 4-BA focus on neurotoxicity and advise against use rather than providing reliable dosing, reinforcing that there is no ‘established’ safe dose. citeturn11reddit14 Cardiac strain and vasoconstriction concerns suggest those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or on QT-prolonging/pressors should avoid entirely; stimulant HR pages highlight these effects for amphetamines generally. citeturn14search5 Post-acute low mood, anxiety, and sleep disruption are plausible due to serotonergic and catecholaminergic depletion; community warnings specifically mention prolonged 5-hydroxyindole depletion after exposure to para-halogenated amphetamines. citeturn11reddit13 If a vendor is offering 4-BA/4-CMA, community advisories recommend warning others and not stocking/using; some vendors have been called out for listing such neurotoxins recently, increasing the risk of mis-selling into stimulant markets. citeturn12reddit12turn12reddit15",

Most retail 4-HO-MET is the fumarate salt due to better stability; keep airtight, dry, opaque, and cold (freezer with desiccant) to slow oxidation/darkening; color change does not reliably indicate potency loss, but degradation is possible over time. Avoid vaporizing/smoking salts; 4-substituted tryptamines tend to thermally degrade and give unreliable effects; oral is most characterized and predictable. Insufflation has a faster onset and shorter duration but is irritating and moreish; nasal care (saline rinse) helps, and redosing is often less efficient due to rapid tachyphylaxis. Dangerous interactions include MAOIs (potentiate/instability), lithium (documented seizures with serotonergic psychedelics), and tramadol (seizure and serotonin toxicity risk); avoid triptans near dosing windows for added serotonergic/vasoconstrictive risk. SSRIs/SNRIs commonly blunt psychedelic effects and make dose-response unpredictable; do not increase dose to compensate without caution. Combining with stimulants or empathogens can markedly increase cardiovascular load and anxiety; if combining at all, use lower doses than usual and cool environments. Cannabis can strongly amplify visuals and anxiety on 4-HO-MET; introduce late and gently if at all. Keep a calm, trusted sitter for first trials; if severe anxiety/overstimulation occurs, a measured benzodiazepine dose can de-escalate but impairs memory/coordination—avoid alcohol and other depressants concurrently. Tolerance to serotonergic psychedelics rises rapidly after a session and decays over about 7–14 days; cross-tolerance occurs with LSD/psilocybin/other tryptamines—spacing sessions reduces dose creep and preserves psychological integration.",

  "notes": "5‑MeO‑DMT is extremely potent and fast‑acting; vapourized breakthrough effects can occur from as little as 3–5 mg in some users, so pre-measuring on a 0.001 g scale and avoiding “eyeballing” is critical for safety. Acute, short-lived non‑responsiveness and loss of motor control are frequently reported above ~8–10 mg smoked/vaporized or ~15–20 mg insufflated; a sober sitter and a clear, padded space reduce injury risk during the 3–10 minute peak. Combining 5‑MeO‑DMT with MAO inhibitors (harmala alkaloids or pharmaceutical MAOIs) greatly elevates systemic 5‑MeO‑DMT and bufotenine exposure and has been implicated in severe toxicity; avoid this combination entirely. Serotonergic medications and agents (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs, MDMA, tramadol, DXM, linezolid, 5‑HTP) can raise the risk of serotonin syndrome; spacing and medical advice are prudent if prescribed such drugs. Depressants like alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines add sedation and aspiration risk during peak non‑responsiveness; at least one fatality following insufflation involved concurrent heavy alcohol use. Nasal use is better suited to salt forms (HCl/fumarate); freebase burns and absorbs poorly, and onset is slower with a more extended after‑period. Oral 5‑MeO‑DMT is generally inactive without MAO‑A inhibition; because MAOIs substantially increase risk, oral/“pharmahuasca” approaches with 5‑MeO‑DMT are not recommended. “Bufo”/toad secretion contains additional, variably present compounds and has inconsistent potency; synthetic 5‑MeO‑DMT permits accurate dosing and avoids wildlife/ethical harms. Start with the lowest end of dose ranges, use a temperature‑controlled vaporization method (avoid direct flame charring), and pre‑arrange recovery position guidance with a sitter in case of vomiting. Individuals with cardiovascular disease, seizure history, or unstable psychiatric conditions should avoid use; prolonged anxiety or destabilization can occur in some users and may require integration support. Expect rapid tolerance within a session; redosing during the peak typically produces diminished or dysphoric effects, and spacing sessions by at least several days is prudent.",

  "notes": "Reasoning and evidence for each harm‑reduction addition:\n- Legal/scheduling and non‑approval: DrugBank lists Acetorphine as Experimental/Illicit and not approved; isomerdesign’s compiled schedules list it as US CSA Schedule I, UK Class A, and Canada Schedule I. This means any human possession or use carries severe legal risk and there is no medical dosing guidance. citeturn2view0turn7search2\n- Extreme potency by class and absence of human dosing: Acetorphine is an oripavine/morphinan derivative closely related to etorphine; there are no validated human dosing data on DrugBank or PubChem. Treat as ultra‑potent; any attempt to extrapolate from veterinary practice is unsafe. citeturn2view0turn3view0\n- Depressant combination risks: Authoritative harm‑reduction tables emphasize that opioids combined with benzodiazepines or GHB/GBL are dangerous due to synergistic respiratory depression; large observational datasets also show higher severity for benzo+opioid ED visits. These interactions are therefore listed as Dangerous. citeturn12search1turn15search3\n- Gabapentinoids with opioids: Systematic evidence synthesized on NCBI Bookshelf shows increased overdose mortality and hospital/ED utilization when gabapentin or pregabalin are co‑prescribed with opioids; hence marked as Caution. citeturn15search0turn15search6\n- MAOIs and certain opioids: TripSit’s interaction guidance and supporting literature flag rare but severe reactions (excitatory and depressive) when opioids are combined with MAOIs; avoid. citeturn12search1\n- Tramadol with other opioids: TripSit cites elevated seizure risk and additive respiratory depression; listed as Unsafe. citeturn12search1\n- Overdose response: Community guidelines on opioid overdose care emphasize airway support and naloxone administration, with re‑dosing/monitoring due to naloxone’s shorter action versus many opioids. For ultra‑potent opioids, anticipate multiple naloxone doses and prioritize ventilation until definitive care. citeturn14search7\n- Duration: No human PK/PD data are available on DrugBank; field experience is veterinary and not transferable to humans; we avoid numeric claims. citeturn2view0\n- Category correction: Acetorphine is an opioid; it is not a dissociative. DrugBank classifies it structurally as a morphinan; dissociatives act primarily via NMDA antagonism, which is not applicable here. citeturn2view0\nOperational harm‑reduction guidance:\n- Do not attempt any human dosing or self‑experimentation. There is no safe dose window established and fatal toxicity can occur at extremely low exposures compared with common opioids. citeturn2view0\n- Never combine with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, Z‑drugs, GHB/GBL); these combinations are over‑represented in severe ED outcomes. citeturn12search1turn15search3\n- If any exposure is suspected: call emergency services immediately, provide rescue breathing if needed, and administer naloxone promptly; repeat doses may be required. Monitor for renarcotization. citeturn14search7\n- Gabapentinoids and first‑generation antihistamines substantially increase sedation and respiratory depression; avoid co‑use. citeturn15search0\n- Avoid MAOIs and tramadol with any potent opioid due to seizure and atypical reactions. citeturn12search1\n- Legal risk is high across jurisdictions (US/UK/CA scheduling as a narcotic). citeturn7search2",

  "notes": "Apomorphine is a fast-acting non‑ergoline dopamine agonist used as a rescue for 'off' episodes in advanced Parkinson’s disease; it has no opioid effects despite its name. 5‑HT3 antiemetics such as ondansetron or granisetron are contraindicated with apomorphine because the combination has produced profound hypotension and loss of consciousness; do not use these for nausea prophylaxis with apomorphine. In regions where available, domperidone (peripheral D2 antagonist) is often used for 72 hours before initiating apomorphine to reduce nausea and hypotension; in the US, trimethobenzamide has historically been used instead—avoid 5‑HT3 agents for this purpose. Initial test dosing and titration should occur under medical supervision because orthostatic hypotension, syncope, or severe emesis can occur during early titration. Sublingual and subcutaneous routes have rapid onsets (about 10–20 minutes) and short durations; sublingual film half‑life is longer than IV, which can extend effects. Daytime somnolence and sudden sleep attacks have been reported with dopamine agonists; avoid driving/operating machinery until you know your response. Alcohol and other CNS depressants can increase dizziness, sedation, and fall risk, especially during dose escalation. Antipsychotics that block D2 receptors can blunt apomorphine’s benefit and exacerbate parkinsonism; coordinate care if such agents are necessary. Injection-site rotation and proper subcutaneous technique reduce local reactions when using pens or pumps; infusion is reserved for frequent, prolonged 'off' periods under specialist care. Kynmobi sublingual film (10–30 mg) was marketed 2020–2023 in the US and then discontinued for commercial reasons; subcutaneous products and infusion systems remain available in many regions.

  "notes": "Apomorphine is a fast-acting non‑ergoline dopamine agonist used as a rescue for 'off' episodes in advanced Parkinson’s disease; it has no opioid effects despite its name. 5‑HT3 antiemetics such as ondansetron or granisetron are contraindicated with apomorphine because the combination has produced profound hypotension and loss of consciousness; do not use these for nausea prophylaxis with apomorphine. In regions where available, domperidone (peripheral D2 antagonist) is often used for 72 hours before initiating apomorphine to reduce nausea and hypotension; in the US, trimethobenzamide has historically been used instead—avoid 5‑HT3 agents for this purpose. Initial test dosing and titration should occur under medical supervision because orthostatic hypotension, syncope, or severe emesis can occur during early titration. Sublingual and subcutaneous routes have rapid onsets (about 10–20 minutes) and short durations; sublingual film half‑life is longer than IV, which can extend effects. Daytime somnolence and sudden sleep attacks have been reported with dopamine agonists; avoid driving/operating machinery until you know your response. Alcohol and other CNS depressants can increase dizziness, sedation, and fall risk, especially during dose escalation. Antipsychotics that block D2 receptors can blunt apomorphine’s benefit and exacerbate parkinsonism; coordinate care if such agents are necessary. Injection-site rotation and proper subcutaneous technique reduce local reactions when using pens or pumps; infusion is reserved for frequent, prolonged 'off' periods under specialist care. Kynmobi sublingual film (10–30 mg) was marketed 2020–2023 in the US and then discontinued for commercial reasons; subcutaneous products and infusion systems remain available in many regions. Always verify cardiovascular status (including orthostatic blood pressures) during initiation and when adjusting doses.",

  "notes": "Clonazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine; mean elimination half-life is ~30–40 hours, so effects and impairment can persist into the next day and accumulate with repeated dosing. Combining benzodiazepines with opioids and/or alcohol greatly increases the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression; avoid co-use and be extra cautious if there is any chance opioids are involved. If opioids may be present, naloxone reverses the opioid component but not clonazepam; always call emergency services and place the person in the recovery position if breathing is slow/shallow or they are unresponsive. Flumazenil (benzodiazepine antidote) should not be used outside medical care because it can precipitate seizures in benzodiazepine-dependent users or mixed overdoses. Clonazepam’s metabolism involves hepatic CYP3A4; strong inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolides, cimetidine) may raise levels and sedation, while enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) may lower them; dose stacking to compensate is risky. Due to poor water solubility (<0.1 mg/mL) and tablet binders, non-oral routes (e.g., injection) are unsafe and can cause serious tissue harm; stick to oral use as intended. Expect pronounced anterograde amnesia at higher doses; avoid important decisions, cooking, or risky activities, and do not drive or operate machinery for at least a full waking day after moderate-to-strong doses. Paradoxical agitation/disinhibition can occur, especially with alcohol or in susceptible individuals; if agitation appears, do not redose benzodiazepines or add alcohol—seek a calm environment and supportive monitoring. Counterfeit ‘benzo’ tablets are common; only use pharmacy-dispensed clonazepam or have unknown tablets checked by a competent drug-checking service when available. For non-medical contexts, minimize frequency (e.g., spacing uses by weeks), avoid daily use, and do not escalate doses to chase effects; tolerance and dependence can develop quickly. People with respiratory disease, sleep apnea, liver impairment, or older adults are more sensitive to sedation and respiratory depression; lower doses and extra caution are warranted.",

  "notes": "Rationale: Edgewood/NRC analyses identify EA-3167 as one of the longest-lasting anticholinergic incapacitating glycolates, with incapacitation lasting roughly 4–10 days and peak delirium within the first 1–3 days; this extreme duration creates unusually high risks of dehydration, hyperthermia, wandering/accidents, and inability to self‑care. citeturn6view1 Rationale: Two accidental high-dose exposures to EA‑3167 described in NRC review showed mild but noticeable cognitive impairment persisting for approximately six months before full recovery, underscoring the potential for protracted neurocognitive after‑effects following severe intoxication. citeturn6view0 Rationale: Standard toxicology guidance for anticholinergic syndrome supports aggressive supportive care (cooling, IV fluids, urinary retention management) and careful use of IV benzodiazepines for agitation; physostigmine is indicated for severe, confirmed anticholinergic delirium but requires cardiac monitoring and repeat dosing due to short action. Avoid physostigmine in mixed/unknown overdoses (e.g., TCA co‑ingestion). citeturn11search0 Rationale: Additive anticholinergic burden with first‑generation antihistamines, tricyclics, and phenothiazines can worsen delirium, tachycardia, and arrhythmia risk; several carry QT‑prolongation liabilities. citeturn11search1turn11search7 Rationale: Combining with alcohol, opioids, or unsupervised benzodiazepines increases sedation/blackout and aspiration/trauma risk during delirium; clinical benzodiazepine use differs because it is titrated IV with monitoring in emergency settings. citeturn1search0turn11search0 Rationale: Onset to incapacitation around 1–2 h and long distribution into CNS imply that delayed care seeking is common; having sober supervision and rapid access to emergency services is essential if exposure is suspected. citeturn6view1 Rationale: Because effects outlast likely plasma kinetics, serum levels are a poor guide to clinical severity; treatment is guided by toxidrome. citeturn11search0 Rationale: Due to extreme hazard profile, non‑medical use is effectively non‑existent; information is presented solely to prevent harm in accidental or historical exposure contexts. citeturn2search1",

  "notes": "- Street heroin varies widely in purity and is frequently adulterated. Laboratory drug checking has repeatedly found heroin samples containing fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, 4‑ANPP precursors, caffeine/lidocaine cuts, and xylazine; these substantially increase overdose and morbidity risks. Always treat unknown powder as potentially fentanyl‑positive and use fentanyl test strips when feasible. Note that fentanyl strips do not detect nitazenes. citeturn1search12turn7search2turn7search13\n- Xylazine (a veterinary sedative) may be present with heroin/fentanyl (“tranq”). Naloxone should still be given during overdose because it reverses the opioid component, but it does not reverse xylazine’s sedative effects; expect prolonged sedation and provide rescue breathing. citeturn12view0\n- Do not mix with other depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, GHB, barbiturates, Z‑drugs). This combination is a leading pattern in fatal opioid poisonings due to additive respiratory depression. citeturn13search3turn13search2\n- Gabapentinoids (pregabalin/gabapentin) significantly elevate overdose risk, especially with opioids; multiple EU countries report rising fatalities with pregabalin involvement. Avoid this combination. citeturn13search1turn13search12\n- Tolerance drops quickly after even short breaks; resuming a previous dose after abstinence is a common cause of fatal overdose. Start far lower after any lapse. citeturn10search1\n- If injecting, base heroin (No.3) must be acidified with citric or ascorbic acid to dissolve; always use sterile water, new equipment, and avoid sharing to prevent infections (HIV, HBV/HCV, SSTIs). Rotate sites and use the finest appropriate needle and filtration possible. citeturn7search0turn11search1\n- Smoked/insufflated routes generally have a slower onset and slightly lower overdose risk than IV; however, polydrug use still drives most severe outcomes. Use with a trusted person present and have naloxone on hand. citeturn13search4\n- Naloxone saves lives: carry it, train peers, and expect that multiple doses may be required if fentanyl/nitazenes are involved. Take‑home naloxone (THN) programmes are expanding across Europe; pharmacy access is widespread in the US. Continue rescue breathing while awaiting EMS. citeturn4search4turn13search13\n- EUDA notes diamorphine crosses the BBB within ~20 s after injection and has a plasma half‑life of ~3 minutes; much of the clinical effect comes from rapid formation of 6‑MAM and morphine. Oral ingestion is comparatively ineffective. These kinetics explain rapid onset (“rush”), short parent half‑life, and multi‑hour effects. citeturn7search0\n- Terminology warning: “China white” is now often used for non‑heroin synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl analogues). Never assume composition from street names; rely on testing and conservative dosing. citeturn1search12",

  "notes": "Most hydrocodone IR products are co‑formulated with acetaminophen (APAP); keep total APAP from all sources ≤ 4,000 mg in 24 h (lower in hepatic disease or chronic alcohol use) to reduce risk of severe liver injury. Dose‑dumping and fatal overdose can occur if extended‑release hydrocodone (e.g., Hysingla ER, Zohydro ER) is crushed, chewed, or dissolved—swallow whole only. Respiratory depression risk is highest during initiation, after dose increases, or when combined with other CNS depressants; avoid mixing with alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z‑drugs, barbiturates, or GHB/GBL. Hydrocodone is metabolized by CYP2D6 to hydromorphone (active) and by CYP3A4 to norhydrocodone (inactive); strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including ritonavir in Paxlovid) can dangerously raise hydrocodone levels, while inducers can reduce analgesia and precipitate withdrawal; CYP2D6 inhibitors can blunt hydromorphone formation and alter response. Combination with serotonergic drugs (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, some muscle relaxants, tramadol) has produced serotonin‑toxicity cases; monitor or avoid high‑risk combinations. Counterfeit opioid tablets adulterated with potent synthetic opioids (e.g., nitazenes/fentanils) have been reported in Europe; avoid non‑pharmacy pills and consider carrying naloxone; do not use alone. Opioid‑naïve individuals and those with reduced tolerance after a break are at particularly high overdose risk—start low, go slow, and space doses ≥ 4–6 h. Common adverse effects include sedation, miosis, pruritus, nausea, and constipation; maintain bowel regimen (hydration, fiber, stimulant + stool softener as needed). Avoid driving or hazardous tasks while sedated; impairment can persist beyond subjective effects. Seek urgent care for severe drowsiness, slowed or irregular breathing, cyanosis, or unresponsiveness; naloxone is the first‑line reversal for life‑threatening respiratory depression.",

  "notes": "Long onset and long duration increase the risk of impatience-redosing; wait at least 3 hours before considering any change. Many users find cactus teas/extracts cause significant nausea and vomiting; purified salts tend to be gentler but GI upset is still common. Cardiovascular stimulation (increased heart rate and blood pressure) occurs; people with cardiac or hypertension issues should avoid or seek medical clearance. Supply is often misrepresented: pressed “mescaline pills” and microdots are almost never true mescaline and are frequently LSD/DOx/2C-x/MDxx—use reagent testing and, when possible, a lab drug-checking service. Dose by weight with a calibrated mg scale and know the salt form (HCl vs sulfate/citrate) before comparing numbers. Combining with MAOIs (irreversible) or lithium has a poor safety record and should be avoided; RIMAs markedly potentiate and alter character and nausea. Set, setting, and sitter matter: plan 12–16+ hours of downtime, hydrate, avoid heat stress, and have a calm space prepared. Tolerance to classic psychedelics develops quickly and crosses between mescaline, LSD, and psilocin; spacing sessions by 1–2+ weeks helps restore sensitivity. Avoid driving, swimming, or hazardous activities until fully baseline the next day. For severe anxiety or dysphoria, reduce stimulation (lights/sounds), breathe slowly, change environment, and seek support; medical management may involve benzodiazepines but that should be clinician-guided.",

  "notes": "- Purity/formulation matter: street meth is almost always the hydrochloride (HCl) salt, which is water-soluble and directly smokable; meth freebase is an oily liquid and uncommon. Do not attempt to base or re-base street crystals; this creates caustic products and adds risks. Salt-to-base potency differs by ~20% (HCl MW ~185.7 vs base 149.2).  \n- Half-life and duration vary with urine pH: alkalinization markedly slows renal clearance and can extend both duration and adverse effects; acidification speeds clearance. Intentionally altering body pH to tweak duration is risky and discouraged.  \n- Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmia, chest pain) and hyperthermia are leading acute harms; risk escalates with dose, redosing, dehydration, heat, and polydrug stimulant use. Seek urgent care for chest pain, severe headache, or high fever.  \n- Neurotoxicity risk increases with high doses, hyperthermia, and prolonged wakefulness; spacing sessions, sleeping, eating, and keeping cool are protective behaviors.  \n- Redosing drives binges and insomnia. Plan a cutoff time; dose early in the day; avoid stacking routes (e.g., smoking then IV).  \n- Hydration: sip ~250–500 mL/h of water or oral rehydration solution when active/hot; avoid overhydration. Replace electrolytes on long sessions.  \n- Oral care: dry mouth (xerostomia) and bruxism increase caries risk. Prefer water over sugary sodas; use sugar-free gum/lozenges for saliva; brush gently before bed; consider fluoride rinse.  \n- Insufflation: rotate nostrils; use fine powder; rinse with sterile saline after to reduce irritation and septal damage.  \n- Smoking: use heat-control (no direct flame on crystal), avoid sharing pipes/mouthpieces to reduce infection transmission from burns/sores; allow glass to cool to prevent cracks and cuts.  \n- Injection: use new sterile equipment every time; filter with a 0.22 μm wheel filter if possible; avoid ‘acidifying’ crystal HCl; rotate sites; never share equipment; watch for signs of infection or endocarditis (fever, chills, new heart murmur).  \n- Drug checking: if available, use reagent testing or mail-in lab services. Fentanyl test strips can detect contamination but require high dilution to avoid false positives from concentrated stimulants; test every new batch and carry naloxone where contamination is prevalent.  \n- Medicines/supplements: CYP2D6 inhibition (e.g., some antidepressants) can increase active levels; combining with serotonergic or seizure-threshold–lowering drugs (e.g., tramadol) increases risks.  \n- Legal status: Schedule II (US) for limited medical uses; illicit supply varies in purity and may include adulterants; never assume any batch is pure.",

  "notes": "Injecting or otherwise using methcathinone made with potassium permanganate (a common home synthesis) has been repeatedly linked to irreversible manganese-induced parkinsonism; avoid any preparation of uncertain origin and never inject — Mn-related damage does not improve after cessation. Early signs include gait disturbance, hypophonia, and falls; MRI classically shows T1 hyperintensity of the globus pallidus. Redosing pressure is high due to the short duration; spacing doses and setting a firm session cap reduces binge risk and sleep deprivation. Like other stimulants, methcathinone can acutely raise heart rate and blood pressure; those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or arrhythmia risk should avoid use and everyone should avoid strenuous exertion while under the influence. Combining with MAOIs is hazardous (hypertensive crises, hyperthermia) and should be strictly avoided; combining with tramadol or bupropion increases seizure risk. Mixing with alcohol increases dehydration and cardiostress while masking intoxication; with benzodiazepines, sedation can mask stimulant overuse and encourage redosing — treat as a caution-only combination reserved for managing severe agitation. Insufflation is irritating/caustic; use tiny test lines, rotate nostrils, rinse with saline after, and allow mucosa to recover between sessions. Use a precise milligram scale, lab‑verified material when possible, and consider reagent testing/drug checking to rule out substitutions or manganese contamination. Expect a comedown (anxiety, dysphoria, insomnia); nutrition, hydration, and planning sleep ahead of time reduce harm. Frequent use builds tolerance rapidly and can drive dose escalation; spacing sessions (≥1–2 weeks) reduces risk of dependency and persistent mood changes.",

  "notes": "Mirogabalin is an α2δ subunit modulator of voltage‑gated calcium channels, not a GABA(A) agonist; expect sedative and ataxic effects from reduced excitatory neurotransmission rather than direct GABAergic action. Combining with opioids or other CNS depressants substantially increases overdose risk due to additive respiratory depression; this pattern has been implicated in European mortality monitoring for gabapentinoids as a class. If an opioid is present during an overdose, naloxone reverses the opioid but not mirogabalin—continued monitoring and supportive breathing are still required. Like other gabapentinoids, abrupt discontinuation after sustained use can precipitate withdrawal (anxiety, insomnia, tremor, nausea; rarely seizures); taper gradually under medical supervision. Dose accumulation occurs in renal impairment—start lower and extend intervals; older adults are more susceptible to dizziness, confusion, and falls. Avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least 6–8 hours after dosing (longer with higher doses or combinations). Peripheral edema and weight gain can occur in this class; monitor if you have cardiovascular or edema‑prone conditions. To reduce harm: use single‑substance sessions, avoid redosing loops, keep hydrated but not excessive, and never mix with alcohol/benzos/“Z‑drugs”. If using around opioids, ensure ready access to naloxone and do not use alone. Store securely to prevent diversion.",

The mean elimination half‑life is about 8.2 hours (reported range roughly 4–21 h); onset is slow and variable with a typical Tmax around 3 hours, so avoid redosing for at least several hours to minimize cumulative CNS depression. Combining oxazepam with other depressants—particularly alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, or barbiturates—markedly increases risks of respiratory depression, aspiration, overdose, and death; if an opioid is taken accidentally together, seek medical help and place the person in the recovery position. Co-use with gabapentinoids and sedating antihistamines also heightens sedation and overdose risk; avoid or drastically reduce doses if such combinations cannot be avoided. Do not drive or operate machinery after dosing; psychomotor and cognitive impairment can persist into the next day, especially with higher or repeated doses. In patients with sleep apnea or significant respiratory disease, benzodiazepines can worsen hypoventilation and are generally not recommended. Paradoxical agitation, disinhibition, or irritability can occur—stop use and seek medical guidance if these appear. Abrupt discontinuation after regular use can precipitate benzodiazepine withdrawal (rebound anxiety, insomnia, tremor, and, in severe cases, seizures); taper gradually under medical supervision. Pregnancy and breastfeeding: benzodiazepines cross the placenta and appear in breastmilk; neonatal flaccidity, withdrawal, and respiratory depression are reported—avoid unless clearly indicated by a clinician. In older adults, even therapeutic doses are associated with increased risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and possible long‑term dementia associations; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. Because oxazepam’s absorption is slow and its lipophilicity relatively low, non-oral ROAs provide no safety advantage and may increase harms; stick to oral use as prescribed. Consider dose equivalence cautiously when switching: a rough guide is ~20 mg oxazepam ≈ 10 mg diazepam, but individual responses vary—always reduce and re-titrate when converting.",

  "notes": "• Combining oxycodone with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z‑drugs, gabapentinoids, GHB) greatly magnifies risks of overdose, respiratory depression, and death; this is a leading driver of fatalities. TripSit and clinical reviews flag opioid+benzo/gaba combos as dangerous; gabapentinoid co‑prescription doubles opioid‑related mortality in observational data. citeturn6search1turn7search1\n• CYP3A4 strongly affects oxycodone exposure. Adding an inhibitor (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolides, protease inhibitors, grapefruit) after you’re stable on a dose can acutely raise oxycodone levels and cause overdose; starting/stopping inducers (rifampin/carbamazepine/phenytoin/St. John’s wort) can lower levels or, when stopped, rebound them upward. This warning appears in the oxycodone label summaries (MedGen/NCBI) and DrugBank metabolism section. citeturn2search5turn5view2\n• CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, some SSRIs/SNRIs) reduce formation of oxymorphone and can change effect profile (sometimes less analgesia but more parent‑drug sedation). Use extra caution if adding/stopping these. Label summaries note enhanced effects when 3A4 and 2D6 inhibitors are combined. citeturn2search5\n• Counterfeit “oxycodone/Percocet” tablets are common; drug‑checking projects repeatedly find fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, nitazenes (e.g., metonitazene, protonitazepyne), and benzodiazepines (e.g., bromazolam) instead of oxycodone. Use fentanyl test strips, but know they do not detect nitazenes; many onsite FTIR devices also miss <5% content. Laboratory checking where available is safer. citeturn14search4turn8search14turn15search0turn15search12\n• Keep naloxone (or nalmefene) accessible and teach people around you to use it. Naloxone reverses opioid respiratory depression; multiple doses may be required with potent adulterants. Community distribution programs show thousands of overdose reversals. citeturn5view2turn10search15\n• If you only have acetaminophen‑containing products (e.g., Percocet), track total daily APAP from all sources and stay ≤4,000 mg/day to avoid liver injury. Consider a properly performed cold‑water extraction (CWE) to reduce APAP before non‑medical use; never rely on CWE to make unsafe doses “safe.” citeturn16search0turn6search2\n• Prefer oral dosing. Avoid injecting or smoking crushed tablets: insoluble binders and tamper‑resistant matrices raise risks of emboli and serious tissue/organ harm; TripSit explicitly flags IV use of oxycodone tablets as extremely dangerous. citeturn6search2\n• Do not chew/crush ER products (e.g., OxyContin) for non‑medical use: this can release the full dose at once (“dose dumping”) and sharply increase overdose risk. Redose cautiously and leave several hours between doses because sedation/respiratory depression can outlast euphoria. Label summaries and clinical texts warn about this. citeturn5view2\n• When using alone is unavoidable, use tiny test doses, avoid mixing depressants, and arrange a check‑in or use an overdose‑detection line; know basic rescue breathing. If someone is unresponsive, call emergency services, give naloxone, and provide rescue breathing until help arrives.\n• Chronic use: constipation is near‑universal; hydrate, use fiber/osmotic laxatives as needed. Opioid‑induced hyperalgesia can occur; increasing doses may paradoxically worsen pain—seek medical review. citeturn2search1\n• Driving/operating machinery is unsafe while affected. People with sleep apnea, COPD, or on sedatives are at higher risk of nocturnal hypoventilation—start at low doses and avoid co‑depressants.",

  "notes": "Phenobarbital is a long-acting barbiturate used primarily as an anticonvulsant; it enhances GABAA-mediated inhibition and also dampens excitatory transmission, producing dose-dependent CNS and respiratory depression. Its elimination half-life averages roughly 79 hours (range ~53–118 h), which means effects can accumulate across days; redosing on the same day or consecutive days markedly increases overdose risk. As a strong inducer of multiple CYP isoenzymes, phenobarbital reduces the efficacy of many medications, notably combined oral contraceptives (risk of unintended pregnancy) and warfarin (risk of subtherapeutic anticoagulation), and can lower levels of other antiepileptics; users should avoid assuming familiar medications behave normally while on phenobarbital. Barbiturates carry a narrow therapeutic index: toxic and even fatal blood concentrations overlap with or lie not far above therapeutic levels, making self-titration hazardous; overdose deaths typically result from respiratory depression compounded by hypotension and coma. Combining with other CNS depressants (opioids, alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, GHB/GBL, sedating antihistamines, carisoprodol) substantially increases the risk of fatal respiratory depression; this risk persists for days because phenobarbital remains in the body long after the subjective effects fade. Phenobarbital is contraindicated in acute or latent porphyria and should be avoided in significant hepatic impairment; it can precipitate porphyric crises via enzyme induction. Chronic use can cause dependence; abrupt cessation after sustained daily use can provoke severe, potentially life-threatening withdrawal (including seizures)—any stop should be medically supervised and slowly tapered. Avoid driving or tasks requiring alertness for at least 24 hours after dosing (longer with higher or repeated doses), as coordination and reaction time are impaired even when one feels “sober.” If phenobarbital has been used with opioids, naloxone reverses only the opioid component—sedation from phenobarbital may persist and requires airway support and monitoring by professionals. Parenteral phenobarbital must be administered by clinicians; nonmedical IV use (especially of tablet formulations) risks immediate apnea/hypotension and catastrophic local injury; intra-arterial and subcutaneous injection are explicitly unsafe. Use in pregnancy is associated with congenital risks; avoid nonmedical exposure during pregnancy and lactation.",

  },
  "notes": "Piracetam is almost entirely renally excreted unchanged; dose accumulation is possible in renal impairment and the drug is dialyzable, so individuals with reduced kidney function should consult a clinician and consider dose reduction. It exhibits antiplatelet and hemorheologic effects (e.g., reduced platelet aggregation; lower fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor levels), so caution is warranted with concurrent anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and around surgeries or active bleeding conditions. Oral bioavailability is near 100% with Tmax around 1 hour (CSF ~5 h), and steady state in about 3 days; acute ‘stimulant-like’ effects are usually mild, with many benefits reported only after several days of regular dosing. Common side effects include nervousness, insomnia, agitation, and headache; taking doses earlier in the day and splitting the total daily amount may reduce sleep disruption. Some users report racetam-associated headaches that improve with ensuring adequate dietary choline or adding a choline source; this is anecdotal and excessive choline can cause GI upset. Clinical use spans cognitive disorders, vertigo, cortical myoclonus, dyslexia, and sickle cell disease, but evidence quality varies by indication and it is not FDA-approved in the United States. High therapeutic doses (e.g., up to 24 g/day) are used for cortical myoclonus under medical supervision; such dosing outside clinical oversight increases the likelihood of adverse effects (e.g., insomnia, agitation) without proven added benefit in healthy users. Piracetam crosses the placenta; safety in pregnancy and lactation is not established—avoid unless prescribed. Because piracetam products are often purchased online in some regions, product quality can vary; use reputable sources and be cautious of mislabeling—general drug checking practices improve safety even when the risk of adulteration is perceived to be low. Do not substitute piracetam for established treatments (e.g., for epilepsy or cognitive disorders) without clinician guidance; rodent data suggest complex interactions with antiepileptics, but clinical anticonvulsant efficacy is limited. Start low, assess individual sensitivity over several days, and avoid combining with strong stimulants until individual effects are known. citeturn2view0turn4search1turn4search2turn4search14",

Bolus dosing outside monitored settings is strongly discouraged because apnoea or chest wall rigidity can occur before the syringe is empty. Chest/truncal rigidity with potent opioids is more likely with rapid IV pushes; slow administration and airway support are essential in clinical settings. Metabolism is by nonspecific blood/tissue esterases to an inactive acid; CYP inhibitors are not expected to prolong effect. Remifentanil can produce acute tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, especially after higher doses or abrupt cessation of infusions; expect rebound pain/craving within minutes once stopped. In overdose, prioritize airway/ventilation; give naloxone in small, titrated IV boluses (e.g., 0.04 mg) to restore breathing while minimizing severe withdrawal, and be prepared for re-sedation if longer-acting opioids or other depressants are present. Non-medical IV use carries high risks of hypoxia, infection, and BBVs; if people use regardless, sterile technique, low-dead-space syringes, never using alone, and access to naloxone/overdose response training reduce but do not eliminate risk.",

    ]
  },
  "notes": "Key harm-reduction points and rationale: SDX is an orally activated prodrug with low oral bioavailability (~3%) and slow enzymatic conversion; this design aims to reduce rapid spikes in d-MPH and lowers intranasal/IV reinforcement—non-oral misuse is unlikely to enhance effects and may increase harm from excipients. DrugBank PK data support the slow conversion and low SDX bioavailability; intranasal/IV misuse deterrence is an inference consistent with the prodrug model. Cardiovascular screening is important: CNS stimulants can increase BP/HR and, rarely, cause serious events (stroke, MI, sudden death) in predisposed patients; assess personal/family cardiac history and consider baseline vitals before use. Peripheral vasculopathy (e.g., Raynaud’s) is reported with stimulants; keep warm, avoid nicotine, and seek evaluation if finger/toe color changes occur. Stimulants may precipitate or exacerbate psychosis or mania; avoid if unstable psychosis/bipolar and monitor for new hallucinations or mood elevation. Priapism (painful prolonged erections) is a rare but notable risk with methylphenidate-class stimulants; urgent care is required if >4 hours. Co-use with alcohol can increase d-MPH exposure and form ethylphenidate, adding cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity risk; avoid mixing. For sleep, take early in the morning; food does not meaningfully change overall exposure but delays Tmax, which can shift the effect curve later into the day. Appetite and weight loss can occur; maintain nutrition and hydration and consider timing meals around the dose. In youth, chronic stimulant therapy may affect growth trajectories; periodic height/weight checks are recommended (clinical context). Avoid stacking multiple stimulants (including decongestants/energy products) and space dosing to prevent redosing escalations; plan off-days if clinically appropriate to limit tolerance. Never crush/snort/inject contents; beyond low expected efficacy due to prodrug design, excipients and beads can damage tissues or cause emboli if injected. Store securely to prevent diversion and accidental pediatric exposure. Evidence sources: DrugBank serdexmethylphenidate/dexmethylphenidate monographs for PK, cardiovascular/psychiatric warnings, food effects, and metabolism (including ethylphenidate formation); TripSit and community HR resources for general stimulant-mixing cautions; some route-of-abuse deterrence specifics are inferred from the prodrug pharmacology and supported anecdotally by user reports.",

  "notes": "Irreversible MAOI: although the parent drug’s plasma half-life is ~1.5–3.2 hours, enzyme inhibition persists until new MAO is synthesized, so interaction risks remain for at least 14 days after stopping (and often 10–21 days). Maintain a 14‑day washout when switching to or from serotonergic antidepressants; extend to 5 weeks after fluoxetine due to its long half-life. Hypertensive crisis (“cheese reaction”) can occur from dietary tyramine or sympathomimetic drugs; earliest sign is often a severe occipital headache, and can progress to chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, confusion, and seizures — seek emergency care immediately. Serotonin syndrome risk is high if combined with serotonergic medicines (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs, clomipramine, MDMA, tramadol, DXM, linezolid, methylene blue); symptoms include agitation, hyperreflexia, clonus, fever, diaphoresis, diarrhea — urgent evaluation is required. Avoid OTC cold/cough products that contain dextromethorphan or decongestants (pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine); many carry a label warning against use within 14 days of an MAOI. Follow a low‑tyramine diet throughout therapy and for 2 weeks after stopping; avoid aged cheeses, cured/fermented meats, soy sauce/miso/yeast extracts, fava beans, and tap/draft beers; packaged spirits in modest amounts still require caution for hypotension/CNS effects. For planned surgery or dental procedures, inform anesthesia providers; some agents (e.g., meperidine, serotonergic antiemetics) are contraindicated, and perioperative plans may need adjustment. Tranylcypromine has a stimulant-like profile and can cause insomnia and orthostatic hypotension; dosing earlier in the day and dividing doses may reduce insomnia and BP swings. Rare hepatotoxicity has been reported; baseline and periodic liver function and blood pressure monitoring are prudent in clinical use.

  "notes": "Trazodone is a SARI that at low doses primarily blocks 5‑HT2A/H1/alpha‑1 receptors and is sedating, while at higher antidepressant doses it also meaningfully inhibits the serotonin transporter; this dose‑dependent pharmacology explains why 25–100 mg often helps sleep but does not treat depression without daytime dosing. It should be taken after food when possible to lessen lightheadedness and orthostatic hypotension, a common early adverse effect due to alpha‑1 blockade. Clinically important risks include QT prolongation and rare torsades de pointes; combinations with other QT‑prolonging agents or in patients with cardiac disease/electrolyte derangements warrant extra caution and consideration of ECG monitoring. Priapism is a rare but serious emergency; an erection lasting more than 4 hours or painful erections require immediate ER evaluation; risk may be higher early in treatment and in those with hematologic diseases (e.g., sickle cell) or penile anatomic variants. CNS depression is additive with alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z‑drugs, opioids, and gabapentinoids; combining increases risk of respiratory depression, impaired driving, and falls—avoid or minimize and use the lowest effective doses with planned timing. Serotonin syndrome can occur when combined with MAOIs, linezolid, IV methylene blue, or other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, tramadol, triptans, dextromethorphan, fentanyl, St John’s Wort); observe a 14‑day washout from MAOIs and monitor for agitation, tremor/clonus, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (clarithromycin, azole antifungals, ritonavir) and grapefruit juice can raise trazodone exposure—leading to more sedation, hypotension, and arrhythmia risk—while CYP3A4 inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St John’s Wort) can reduce efficacy. Older adults are more susceptible to hyponatremia/SIADH and orthostatic hypotension; check sodium if confusion, headache, seizures, or falls occur, and consider dose reductions. Hepatic metabolism is primary and rare idiosyncratic liver injury has been reported; obtain baseline LFTs and recheck if clinically indicated or if symptoms (e.g., jaundice, dark urine, pruritus) develop. There are reports of increased INR with warfarin and increased digoxin levels; monitor especially after initiation or dose changes. Screen for bipolar spectrum illness before starting because antidepressant‑induced switching or mania has been reported; discontinue if mania emerges. Avoid driving, cycling, operating machinery, or engaging in safety‑critical tasks until you know your next‑day alertness; next‑morning impairment is more likely with higher doses, interactions, sleep deprivation, or when combined with other depressants. Discontinuation should be gradual to reduce rebound insomnia and withdrawal‑like symptoms (nausea, dysphoria, agitation, paresthesias).",

A boxed warning applies to the class for opioid co\u2011use. Alprazolam is primarily metabolized by CYP3A; strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, fluvoxamine) and grapefruit can raise levels markedly; strong inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John\u2019s wort) can lower levels and precipitate withdrawal or loss of effect. Street \u201cXanax\u201d bars are frequently misrepresented; drug\u2011checking services have repeatedly found potent designer benzodiazepines (e.g., flualprazolam, norflurazepam) or other unexpected actives in tablets sold as alprazolam. Use professional drug checking where available and avoid assuming imprint/appearance equals identity. Do not stop suddenly after repeated dosing; benzodiazepine withdrawal can include seizures and delirium. Tapering should be gradual and medically supervised; flumazenil can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent users and is generally avoided outside specific monitored indications. Alprazolam impairs attention, memory, and coordination; avoid driving or hazardous tasks while affected and after high or interacting doses. Avoid non\u2011oral routes: crushing tablets for injection/insufflation introduces fillers that can damage tissue and vasculature, and increases risk without added safety. Rapid onset and short/moderate duration encourage redosing and can accelerate tolerance; spacing use and conservative dosing reduce risk.",

    "notes": "GBL is a prodrug rapidly converted to GHB in vivo; relative to GHB it is more potent by volume and has a faster, sharper onset, which increases overdose risk from small mismeasurements. GBL is a skin/mucosal irritant solvent; always dilute in a non\u2011alcoholic drink before swallowing, avoid contact with eyes/skin, and never inject or insufflate. The dose\u2011response curve is steep: recreational doses lie close to doses causing unrousable sleep and, at higher levels or when mixed with other depressants, life\u2011threatening respiratory depression. Redosing too soon causes stacking: wait at least 2 hours between doses and reduce any redose; dopamine\u2011rebound wakefulness 3\u20135 hours later can create a strong compulsion to redose but increases risk of dependence. Food reduces/slow s absorption; many HR groups suggest dosing at least 2 hours after eating and avoiding further redose until effects fully plateau. Never combine with alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, barbiturates, Z\u2011drugs, or other depressants; ketamine with G markedly increases loss of consciousness and breathing problems. If someone becomes unrousable, place them in the recovery position, keep airway clear, monitor breathing, and seek emergency help; do not \u2018wake\u2019 them with stimulants or give more substances. Tolerance can develop in days with frequent use; withdrawal may begin within 1\u20136 hours after the last dose and can escalate to agitation, delirium, tachycardia, and life\u2011threatening complications \u2014 medical supervision is essential for dependent users. Concentration varies by source and bottles; unknown dilution is common \u2014 start low (0.3\u20130.5 mL), measure precisely to 0.1 mL, and label doses/times to avoid mistakes. GHB/GBL may reduce efficacy of some HIV medications; avoid co\u2011use and consult a clinician if on antiretrovirals. As a solvent, GBL can degrade some plastics; prefer glass (or chemically resistant equipment) for storage/measurement, clearly label, add a food\u2011safe dye to avoid accidental ingestion, and keep locked away from children/pets. Do not drive or operate machinery; some HR groups advise waiting at least 24 hours after last dose before driving due to residual impairment and stacking.",

Choose single-ingredient DXM-only products if one insists on use. \u2022 DXM effects and safety vary strongly with CYP2D6 genotype and with inhibitors: poor metabolizers or those on potent 2D6 inhibitors can experience unusually long, dysphoric, or toxic effects from doses others tolerate; always test with a low dose and avoid redosing if metabolism is unknown. \u2022 Serotonin syndrome is the key life-threatening interaction (triad of autonomic instability, neuromuscular hyperactivity, and altered mental status). Avoid combining DXM with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, tramadol, MDMA, 5-HTP, or St. John\u2019s wort. \u2022 Extended-release polistirex (Delsym) is often perceived as \u2018half as strong, twice as long\u2019: onset is slower, peaks are broader, and impairment lasts much longer\u2014harder to manage in uncontrolled settings; plan extra recovery time and avoid redosing. \u2022 Redosing to \u2018stack plateaus\u2019 increases the risk of the so\u2011called Plateau Sigma pattern (days-long delirium/psychosis-like states); most accounts rate it as extremely unpleasant and risky\u2014avoid intentional Sigma pursuit. \u2022 Ataxia and nystagmus (\u2018robo-walk\u2019) increase fall/accident risk; do not drive or do hazardous activities. Use in a safe, calm setting with a sober sitter at higher plateaus. \u2022 Frequent use rapidly builds tolerance and worsens after-effects; spacing uses by multiple weeks reduces cumulative harm. \u2022 Chronic heavy DXM HBr use can add significant bromide load; rare cases of bromism present with neuropsychiatric symptoms and spurious hyperchloremia\u2014seek medical care if prolonged confusion/neurologic symptoms occur. \u2022 DXM can produce false-positive immunoassay urine screens for PCP (and occasionally other classes); confirmatory GC/MS usually resolves this. Carry medication info if testing is expected. \u2022 Avoid products branded Coricidin HBP (\u2018Triple C\u2019) and other multi-ingredient tablets widely linked to adverse events; the non-DXM actives drive much of the toxicity.",

    "notes": "Identity and purity in the current supply are uncertain; drug checking is strongly advised because mislabeling and unexpected contents in powders/crystals are common in unregulated markets. Start with a low single dose, wait at least 2 hours before considering any redose, and avoid stacking multiple redoses to reduce cardiac and insomnia risks. As with methylphenidate analogs, expect dose\u2011dependent increases in heart rate, blood pressure, anxiety, jaw tension, and appetite suppression; those with cardiovascular or anxiety disorders should exercise heightened caution. Intranasal use can damage nasal mucosa over time; divide lines finely, use each nostril sparingly, rinse with saline after sessions, and avoid sharing equipment to reduce infection risk. Avoid injecting; if someone is intent on IV use, sterile technique, allergy testing with a tiny fraction dose, and filtration are essential to reduce acute harms from insoluble binders or contaminants. Combining with MAOIs is hazardous due to hypertensive events; avoid this combination entirely. Tramadol plus stimulants can lower seizure threshold and increase serotonin toxicity risk; avoid co\u2011use and space by many half\u2011lives if medically required. Stimulant comedowns can be mitigated with sleep hygiene, fluids, electrolytes, gentle nutrition, and time; avoid chasing sleep with high\u2011dose alcohol or benzodiazepines due to masking/overdose risk. Because potency appears lower than methylphenidate for many, there is a temptation to escalate doses; use a calibrated milligram scale, consider volumetric solutions for accurate micro\u2011titration, and cap the session length before starting. Insomnia is common after late\u2011day dosing; avoid use within 8\u201312 hours of planned sleep. Cross\u2011tolerance with other phenidates is likely; leave sufficient spacing (several days or longer) between sessions to reduce tolerance and binge\u2011cycle risk.

Discontinue and seek medical care if jaundice, right\u2011upper\u2011quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, or marked fatigue occur. \u2022 Consider baseline and periodic liver function tests (ALT/AST/bilirubin) if using beyond single occasional trials or more than once weekly; avoid if you have known liver disease. \u2022 Avoid stacking with hepatotoxins (heavy alcohol, high/repeated acetaminophen, anabolic steroids, isoniazid, high\u2011dose vitamin A) during the same week of use. \u2022 Onset can be variable; some users report very delayed or stepwise onsets and sudden intensity several hours later. Because of this, do not redose for several hours after an initial dose. \u2022 Cardiovascular screening and monitoring similar to other stimulants is prudent: avoid if you have uncontrolled hypertension, significant heart disease, or hyperthyroidism; check blood pressure/heart rate during first trials. \u2022 MAOIs are contraindicated with sympathomimetic stimulants due to hypertensive crises\u2014do not combine within 14 days of MAOI use. \u2022 Combining with other stimulants or high caffeine increases risks of anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, bruxism, and insomnia; spacing such agents is safer. \u2022 Subjective effects are often described as functional stimulation with focus and minimal euphoria; however, some users experience marked anxiety, body load, and dysphoria at doses others find moderate\u2014start low, titrate cautiously. \u2022 Prefer oral administration; insufflation appears in anecdotes but offers no safety advantage and may increase adverse effects. \u2022 Product authenticity/purity is uncertain in gray markets; reagent references for cyclazodone are sparse. Where possible, use professional GC/MS drug checking; otherwise, avoid multi\u2011gram purchases and unknown vendors. \u2022 Tolerance to stimulation builds with frequent use; spacing use by several days reduces tolerance and cumulative strain on the liver and sleep. \u2022 There is no established human half\u2011life; effects are long enough that late\u2011day dosing can impair sleep. \u2022 Do not combine with decongestants (pseudoephedrine/phenylephrine) or other adrenergics due to additive pressor effects. \u2022 Avoid during pregnancy or if trying to conceive; there are no human safety data.",

    "notes": "Identity and data scarcity: CFPP is an obscure halogenated phenylpiperazine with essentially no published human pharmacology; most available information comes from class\u2011level summaries and older community reports about phenylpiperazines (mCPP, TFMPP, pFPP). Mislabeling/adulteration with piperazines has historically been common in \u2018ecstasy\u2019 markets; laboratory drug checking is strongly advised over reagent\u2011only testing. Reports from mCPP/TFMPP users consistently mention dysphoria, anxiety/panic, nausea, headaches/migraines, thermoregulation changes and a multi\u2011day \u2018hangover\u2019; CFPP likely shares a similar adverse\u2011effect profile by structural analogy. Serotonergic toxicity can occur when combined with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM, triptans, lithium or other serotonergics\u2014avoid these combinations and seek urgent care if symptoms of serotonin syndrome (agitation, hyperreflexia/clonus, sweating, fever) appear. Phenylpiperazines tend to be more \u2018body\u2011loady\u2019 than euphoric; start with an allergy test (\u22481\u20132 mg), use oral dosing rather than insufflation to reduce local irritation and headache, and avoid redosing\u2014users report that redoses often deepen adverse effects without improving mood. Cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, hypertension) are part of this class; keep cool, take measured breaks from dancing/exertion, sip fluids modestly, and avoid both over\u2011 and under\u2011hydration. Because CFPP\u2019s metabolism and half\u2011life are unknown, allow the full duration plus at least several hours before considering any additional substances. If severe anxiety, tremor or overheating develops, prioritize cooling, rest and consider a benzodiazepine in standard therapeutic doses if not contraindicated; seek medical help for high fever, confusion, chest pain, or persistent vomiting.",

Insufflation produces a faster, sharper onset and is commonly described as painful/irritating; oral use is easier to titrate. Product stability varies: exposure to heat, moisture, and oxygen can darken material over time (often towards tan/brown) and partial hydrolysis to psilocin may occur; potency may drift and batches may co\u2011contain psilocin\u2014test and start low with new supplies. Salt form differences (fumarate vs HCl) change mass\u2011by\u2011mass potency only modestly; Erowid\u2019s chemistry notes suggest the typical fumarate is diprotic, making the practical potency gap just a few percent rather than ~25% as sometimes claimed. Community drug\u2011checking data and reports have found some samples containing both 4\u2011AcO\u2011DMT and psilocin, consistent with hydrolysis or co\u2011formulation. Store airtight, dry, and cold (freezer, desiccant, light\u2011protected) to slow degradation; avoid long\u2011term aqueous solutions. Test with Ehrlich\u2019s (indole positive but non\u2011specific); reagent testing cannot reliably confirm identity\u2014lab analysis is required. Avoid use if you or close family have psychotic or bipolar spectrum disorders; psychedelics can precipitate mania/psychosis in susceptible individuals.
