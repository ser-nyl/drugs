    "notes": "25I‑NBOMe is an ultra‑potent 5‑HT2A agonist active at microgram doses; the difference between a strong and dangerous dose can be small, particularly with nasal use or concentrated liquids. Numerous severe toxicities and fatalities have been reported, especially from misidentified blotters and insufflated powders. Reagent testing is essential when a blotter is sold as “LSD”: Ehrlich/Hofmann positive and a lack of rapid, vivid Marquis color change support lysergamide; NBOMes generally show no Ehrlich/Hofmann reaction and often give pronounced Marquis reactions on paper. Taste is not diagnostic, but a strong bitter/metallic taste with oral numbness is commonly reported for NBOMes; treat as a warning and test. Never eyeball powder; prepare measured solutions (volumetric dosing) and label concentrations clearly to avoid accidental overdoses. Because oral (swallowed) bioavailability is unreliable, sublingual/buccal absorption is the typical route; hold for 15–30 minutes before spitting/swallowing. Significant vasoconstriction (cold/numb extremities, cramps, hypertension) and agitation can occur; avoid stimulants, strenuous activity, overheating, and stay hydrated with small sips. In an emergency (seizure, hyperthermia, severe agitation, chest pain, uncontrolled hypertension), seek immediate medical help; clinicians typically use benzodiazepines and supportive care. NBOMes have frequently been laid on blotters resembling LSD; do not assume any blotter is LSD without testing. Strong cross‑tolerance exists with classical psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DOx, 2C‑x), and redosing within days will be less effective yet may increase side‑effects. Legal status: controlled in many jurisdictions (e.g., EU control recommended 2014; US Schedule I since 2016).",

    "notes": "3‑MeO‑PCP is active in the single‑milligram range; inaccurate scales can lead to large relative dosing errors, so volumetric dosing is strongly recommended. The dose–response curve is steep and onset can be delayed, making premature redosing a common cause of accidental over-intoxication. It is an NMDA receptor antagonist and has been described by TripSit as also exhibiting mild serotonin reuptake inhibition, so combinations with serotonergic substances warrant extra caution. Compared with ketamine, it can produce clearer stimulation but is also more likely to induce ambulatory delirium, disinhibition, and manic or psychotic states at strong doses. Erowid documents that at least one death has been associated with 3‑MeO‑PCP and warns of episodes where users cannot distinguish fantasy from reality, increasing risk of harm in uncontrolled environments. Avoid mixing with alcohol or benzodiazepines due to unpredictable sedation and accident risk; avoid driving or hazardous activities until the next day because after‑effects can persist up to 48 hours. People with a personal or family history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or mania should avoid due to elevated risk of psychiatric destabilization. The RC market is prone to mislabeling and variable purity; reagent testing and conservative allergy tests reduce risk. Tolerance builds rapidly with frequent use; spacing sessions by multiple weeks reduces both tolerance and compulsive redosing patterns.",

    "notes": "Rationale for additions (harm reduction): Para-halogenated amphetamines such as p-chloroamphetamine are used as serotonergic neurotoxins in animal research; community moderators and chemistry-focused users warn that 4-BA is analogous and likely neurotoxic, so conservative guidance treats it as a high-risk agent with poor recreational value; therefore, the safest advice is avoidance or, failing that, very cautious titration with no redosing. Reagent kits are not sufficient to characterize 4-BA; if a sample is suspected, submit to a mass-spectrometry drug checking service where available; these services publish ongoing findings and are designed to help people make safer choices. Mixing with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM, triptans, methylene blue, or other serotonergic agents can precipitate dangerously elevated serotonin and autonomic instability; TripSit’s combinations guidance supports avoiding serotonergic-stimulant + antidepressant/MAOI stacks. Even plain amphetamines raise heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature; overheating and dehydration increase risk with any stimulant, so active cooling, spacing doses, and electrolyte-containing fluids are advised; TripSit’s amphetamine factsheets (e.g., Adderall/Vyvanse) emphasize tachycardia, hypertension, dehydration, and hyperthermia risks. Intranasal use can spike plasma levels and may increase neurotoxic and cardiovascular stress relative to cautious oral dosing; oral-only is the least risky ROA if someone does not abstain. This general ROA principle is reflected across harm-reduction communities and TripSit resources. Because validated human pharmacokinetics are lacking, any stated duration and dosing should be treated as uncertain; community posts about 4-BA focus on neurotoxicity and advise against use rather than providing reliable dosing, reinforcing that there is no ‘established’ safe dose. Cardiac strain and vasoconstriction concerns suggest those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or on QT-prolonging/pressors should avoid entirely; stimulant HR pages highlight these effects for amphetamines generally. Post-acute low mood, anxiety, and sleep disruption are plausible due to serotonergic and catecholaminergic depletion; community warnings specifically mention prolonged 5-hydroxyindole depletion after exposure to para-halogenated amphetamines. If a vendor is offering 4-BA/4-CMA, community advisories recommend warning others and not stocking/using; some vendors have been called out for listing such neurotoxins recently, increasing the risk of mis-selling into stimulant markets.

    "notes": "4-HO-MET is a 4-hydroxylated tryptamine analogous to psilocin; community and Shulgin/TiHKAL notes place oral activity around 10–20 mg with 4–6 h total duration, but sensitivity varies widely—always titrate from low doses with an accurate milligram scale or volumetric dosing. Research chemicals are frequently misrepresented; use drug checking: Ehrlich reagent should turn positive for indoles but only confirms an indole, not identity—use multiple reagents (e.g., Hofmann/Marquis/Mecke) and prefer lab testing when available. Most retail 4-HO-MET is the fumarate salt due to better stability; keep airtight, dry, opaque, and cold (freezer with desiccant) to slow oxidation/darkening; color change does not reliably indicate potency loss, but degradation is possible over time. Avoid vaporizing/smoking salts; 4-substituted tryptamines tend to thermally degrade and give unreliable effects; oral is most characterized and predictable. Insufflation has a faster onset and shorter duration but is irritating and moreish; nasal care (saline rinse) helps, and redosing is often less efficient due to rapid tachyphylaxis. Dangerous interactions include MAOIs (potentiate/instability), lithium (documented seizures with serotonergic psychedelics), and tramadol (seizure and serotonin toxicity risk); avoid triptans near dosing windows for added serotonergic/vasoconstrictive risk. SSRIs/SNRIs commonly blunt psychedelic effects and make dose-response unpredictable; do not increase dose to compensate without caution. Combining with stimulants or empathogens can markedly increase cardiovascular load and anxiety; if combining at all, use lower doses than usual and cool environments. Cannabis can strongly amplify visuals and anxiety on 4-HO-MET; introduce late and gently if at all. Keep a calm, trusted sitter for first trials; if severe anxiety/overstimulation occurs, a measured benzodiazepine dose can de-escalate but impairs memory/coordination—avoid alcohol and other depressants concurrently. Tolerance to serotonergic psychedelics rises rapidly after a session and decays over about 7–14 days; cross-tolerance occurs with LSD/psilocybin/other tryptamines—spacing sessions reduces dose creep and preserves psychological integration.",

    "notes": "5‑MeO‑DMT is extremely potent and fast‑acting; vapourized breakthrough effects can occur from as little as 3–5 mg in some users, so pre-measuring on a 0.001 g scale and avoiding “eyeballing” is critical for safety. Acute, short-lived non‑responsiveness and loss of motor control are frequently reported above ~8–10 mg smoked/vaporized or ~15–20 mg insufflated; a sober sitter and a clear, padded space reduce injury risk during the 3–10 minute peak. Combining 5‑MeO‑DMT with MAO inhibitors (harmala alkaloids or pharmaceutical MAOIs) greatly elevates systemic 5‑MeO‑DMT and bufotenine exposure and has been implicated in severe toxicity; avoid this combination entirely. Serotonergic medications and agents (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs, MDMA, tramadol, DXM, linezolid, 5‑HTP) can raise the risk of serotonin syndrome; spacing and medical advice are prudent if prescribed such drugs. Depressants like alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines add sedation and aspiration risk during peak non‑responsiveness; at least one fatality following insufflation involved concurrent heavy alcohol use. Nasal use is better suited to salt forms (HCl/fumarate); freebase burns and absorbs poorly, and onset is slower with a more extended after‑period. Oral 5‑MeO‑DMT is generally inactive without MAO‑A inhibition; because MAOIs substantially increase risk, oral/“pharmahuasca” approaches with 5‑MeO‑DMT are not recommended. “Bufo”/toad secretion contains additional, variably present compounds and has inconsistent potency; synthetic 5‑MeO‑DMT permits accurate dosing and avoids wildlife/ethical harms. Start with the lowest end of dose ranges, use a temperature‑controlled vaporization method (avoid direct flame charring), and pre‑arrange recovery position guidance with a sitter in case of vomiting. Individuals with cardiovascular disease, seizure history, or unstable psychiatric conditions should avoid use; prolonged anxiety or destabilization can occur in some users and may require integration support. Expect rapid tolerance within a session; redosing during the peak typically produces diminished or dysphoric effects, and spacing sessions by at least several days is prudent.",

    "notes": "Reasoning and evidence for each harm‑reduction addition:\n- Legal/scheduling and non‑approval: DrugBank lists Acetorphine as Experimental/Illicit and not approved; isomerdesign’s compiled schedules list it as US CSA Schedule I, UK Class A, and Canada Schedule I. This means any human possession or use carries severe legal risk and there is no medical dosing guidance.\n- Extreme potency by class and absence of human dosing: Acetorphine is an oripavine/morphinan derivative closely related to etorphine; there are no validated human dosing data on DrugBank or PubChem. Treat as ultra‑potent; any attempt to extrapolate from veterinary practice is unsafe.\n- Depressant combination risks: Authoritative harm‑reduction tables emphasize that opioids combined with benzodiazepines or GHB/GBL are dangerous due to synergistic respiratory depression; large observational datasets also show higher severity for benzo+opioid ED visits. These interactions are therefore listed as Dangerous.\n- Gabapentinoids with opioids: Systematic evidence synthesized on NCBI Bookshelf shows increased overdose mortality and hospital/ED utilization when gabapentin or pregabalin are co‑prescribed with opioids; hence marked as Caution.\n- MAOIs and certain opioids: TripSit’s interaction guidance and supporting literature flag rare but severe reactions (excitatory and depressive) when opioids are combined with MAOIs; avoid.\n- Tramadol with other opioids: TripSit cites elevated seizure risk and additive respiratory depression; listed as Unsafe.\n- Overdose response: Community guidelines on opioid overdose care emphasize airway support and naloxone administration, with re‑dosing/monitoring due to naloxone’s shorter action versus many opioids. For ultra‑potent opioids, anticipate multiple naloxone doses and prioritize ventilation until definitive care.\n- Duration: No human PK/PD data are available on DrugBank; field experience is veterinary and not transferable to humans; we avoid numeric claims.\n- Category correction: Acetorphine is an opioid; it is not a dissociative. DrugBank classifies it structurally as a morphinan; dissociatives act primarily via NMDA antagonism, which is not applicable here.\nOperational harm‑reduction guidance:\n- Do not attempt any human dosing or self‑experimentation. There is no safe dose window established and fatal toxicity can occur at extremely low exposures compared with common opioids.\n- Never combine with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, Z‑drugs, GHB/GBL); these combinations are over‑represented in severe ED outcomes.\n- If any exposure is suspected: call emergency services immediately, provide rescue breathing if needed, and administer naloxone promptly; repeat doses may be required. Monitor for renarcotization.\n- Gabapentinoids and first‑generation antihistamines substantially increase sedation and respiratory depression; avoid co‑use.\n- Avoid MAOIs and tramadol with any potent opioid due to seizure and atypical reactions.\n- Legal risk is high across jurisdictions (US/UK/CA scheduling as a narcotic).

    "notes": "Apomorphine is a fast-acting non‑ergoline dopamine agonist used as a rescue for 'off' episodes in advanced Parkinson’s disease; it has no opioid effects despite its name. 5‑HT3 antiemetics such as ondansetron or granisetron are contraindicated with apomorphine because the combination has produced profound hypotension and loss of consciousness; do not use these for nausea prophylaxis with apomorphine. In regions where available, domperidone (peripheral D2 antagonist) is often used for 72 hours before initiating apomorphine to reduce nausea and hypotension; in the US, trimethobenzamide has historically been used instead—avoid 5‑HT3 agents for this purpose. Initial test dosing and titration should occur under medical supervision because orthostatic hypotension, syncope, or severe emesis can occur during early titration. Sublingual and subcutaneous routes have rapid onsets (about 10–20 minutes) and short durations; sublingual film half‑life is longer than IV, which can extend effects. Daytime somnolence and sudden sleep attacks have been reported with dopamine agonists; avoid driving/operating machinery until you know your response. Alcohol and other CNS depressants can increase dizziness, sedation, and fall risk, especially during dose escalation. Antipsychotics that block D2 receptors can blunt apomorphine’s benefit and exacerbate parkinsonism; coordinate care if such agents are necessary. Injection-site rotation and proper subcutaneous technique reduce local reactions when using pens or pumps; infusion is reserved for frequent, prolonged 'off' periods under specialist care. Kynmobi sublingual film (10–30 mg) was marketed 2020–2023 in the US and then discontinued for commercial reasons; subcutaneous products and infusion systems remain available in many regions. Always verify cardiovascular status (including orthostatic blood pressures) during initiation and when adjusting doses.",

    "notes": "Clonazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine; mean elimination half-life is ~30–40 hours, so effects and impairment can persist into the next day and accumulate with repeated dosing. Combining benzodiazepines with opioids and/or alcohol greatly increases the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression; avoid co-use and be extra cautious if there is any chance opioids are involved. If opioids may be present, naloxone reverses the opioid component but not clonazepam; always call emergency services and place the person in the recovery position if breathing is slow/shallow or they are unresponsive. Flumazenil (benzodiazepine antidote) should not be used outside medical care because it can precipitate seizures in benzodiazepine-dependent users or mixed overdoses. Clonazepam’s metabolism involves hepatic CYP3A4; strong inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolides, cimetidine) may raise levels and sedation, while enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) may lower them; dose stacking to compensate is risky. Due to poor water solubility (<0.1 mg/mL) and tablet binders, non-oral routes (e.g., injection) are unsafe and can cause serious tissue harm; stick to oral use as intended. Expect pronounced anterograde amnesia at higher doses; avoid important decisions, cooking, or risky activities, and do not drive or operate machinery for at least a full waking day after moderate-to-strong doses. Paradoxical agitation/disinhibition can occur, especially with alcohol or in susceptible individuals; if agitation appears, do not redose benzodiazepines or add alcohol—seek a calm environment and supportive monitoring. Counterfeit ‘benzo’ tablets are common; only use pharmacy-dispensed clonazepam or have unknown tablets checked by a competent drug-checking service when available. For non-medical contexts, minimize frequency (e.g., spacing uses by weeks), avoid daily use, and do not escalate doses to chase effects; tolerance and dependence can develop quickly. People with respiratory disease, sleep apnea, liver impairment, or older adults are more sensitive to sedation and respiratory depression; lower doses and extra caution are warranted.",

    "notes": "Rationale: Edgewood/NRC analyses identify EA-3167 as one of the longest-lasting anticholinergic incapacitating glycolates, with incapacitation lasting roughly 4–10 days and peak delirium within the first 1–3 days; this extreme duration creates unusually high risks of dehydration, hyperthermia, wandering/accidents, and inability to self‑care. Rationale: Two accidental high-dose exposures to EA‑3167 described in NRC review showed mild but noticeable cognitive impairment persisting for approximately six months before full recovery, underscoring the potential for protracted neurocognitive after‑effects following severe intoxication. Rationale: Standard toxicology guidance for anticholinergic syndrome supports aggressive supportive care (cooling, IV fluids, urinary retention management) and careful use of IV benzodiazepines for agitation; physostigmine is indicated for severe, confirmed anticholinergic delirium but requires cardiac monitoring and repeat dosing due to short action. Avoid physostigmine in mixed/unknown overdoses (e.g., TCA co‑ingestion). Rationale: Additive anticholinergic burden with first‑generation antihistamines, tricyclics, and phenothiazines can worsen delirium, tachycardia, and arrhythmia risk; several carry QT‑prolongation liabilities. Rationale: Combining with alcohol, opioids, or unsupervised benzodiazepines increases sedation/blackout and aspiration/trauma risk during delirium; clinical benzodiazepine use differs because it is titrated IV with monitoring in emergency settings. Rationale: Onset to incapacitation around 1–2 h and long distribution into CNS imply that delayed care seeking is common; having sober supervision and rapid access to emergency services is essential if exposure is suspected. Rationale: Because effects outlast likely plasma kinetics, serum levels are a poor guide to clinical severity; treatment is guided by toxidrome. Rationale: Due to extreme hazard profile, non‑medical use is effectively non‑existent; information is presented solely to prevent harm in accidental or historical exposure contexts. ",

    "notes": "- Street heroin varies widely in purity and is frequently adulterated. Laboratory drug checking has repeatedly found heroin samples containing fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, 4‑ANPP precursors, caffeine/lidocaine cuts, and xylazine; these substantially increase overdose and morbidity risks. Always treat unknown powder as potentially fentanyl‑positive and use fentanyl test strips when feasible. Note that fentanyl strips do not detect nitazenes.\n- Xylazine (a veterinary sedative) may be present with heroin/fentanyl (“tranq”). Naloxone should still be given during overdose because it reverses the opioid component, but it does not reverse xylazine’s sedative effects; expect prolonged sedation and provide rescue breathing.\n- Do not mix with other depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, GHB, barbiturates, Z‑drugs). This combination is a leading pattern in fatal opioid poisonings due to additive respiratory depression.\n- Gabapentinoids (pregabalin/gabapentin) significantly elevate overdose risk, especially with opioids; multiple EU countries report rising fatalities with pregabalin involvement. Avoid this combination.\n- Tolerance drops quickly after even short breaks; resuming a previous dose after abstinence is a common cause of fatal overdose. Start far lower after any lapse.\n- If injecting, base heroin (No.3) must be acidified with citric or ascorbic acid to dissolve; always use sterile water, new equipment, and avoid sharing to prevent infections (HIV, HBV/HCV, SSTIs). Rotate sites and use the finest appropriate needle and filtration possible.\n- Smoked/insufflated routes generally have a slower onset and slightly lower overdose risk than IV; however, polydrug use still drives most severe outcomes. Use with a trusted person present and have naloxone on hand.\n- Naloxone saves lives: carry it, train peers, and expect that multiple doses may be required if fentanyl/nitazenes are involved. Take‑home naloxone (THN) programmes are expanding across Europe; pharmacy access is widespread in the US. Continue rescue breathing while awaiting EMS.\n- EUDA notes diamorphine crosses the BBB within ~20 s after injection and has a plasma half‑life of ~3 minutes; much of the clinical effect comes from rapid formation of 6‑MAM and morphine. Oral ingestion is comparatively ineffective. These kinetics explain rapid onset (“rush”), short parent half‑life, and multi‑hour effects.\n- Terminology warning: “China white” is now often used for non‑heroin synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl analogues). Never assume composition from street names; rely on testing and conservative dosing. ",

    "notes": "Most hydrocodone IR products are co‑formulated with acetaminophen (APAP); keep total APAP from all sources ≤ 4,000 mg in 24 h (lower in hepatic disease or chronic alcohol use) to reduce risk of severe liver injury. Dose‑dumping and fatal overdose can occur if extended‑release hydrocodone (e.g., Hysingla ER, Zohydro ER) is crushed, chewed, or dissolved—swallow whole only. Respiratory depression risk is highest during initiation, after dose increases, or when combined with other CNS depressants; avoid mixing with alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z‑drugs, barbiturates, or GHB/GBL. Hydrocodone is metabolized by CYP2D6 to hydromorphone (active) and by CYP3A4 to norhydrocodone (inactive); strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including ritonavir in Paxlovid) can dangerously raise hydrocodone levels, while inducers can reduce analgesia and precipitate withdrawal; CYP2D6 inhibitors can blunt hydromorphone formation and alter response. Combination with serotonergic drugs (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, some muscle relaxants, tramadol) has produced serotonin‑toxicity cases; monitor or avoid high‑risk combinations. Counterfeit opioid tablets adulterated with potent synthetic opioids (e.g., nitazenes/fentanils) have been reported in Europe; avoid non‑pharmacy pills and consider carrying naloxone; do not use alone. Opioid‑naïve individuals and those with reduced tolerance after a break are at particularly high overdose risk—start low, go slow, and space doses ≥ 4–6 h. Common adverse effects include sedation, miosis, pruritus, nausea, and constipation; maintain bowel regimen (hydration, fiber, stimulant + stool softener as needed). Avoid driving or hazardous tasks while sedated; impairment can persist beyond subjective effects. Seek urgent care for severe drowsiness, slowed or irregular breathing, cyanosis, or unresponsiveness; naloxone is the first‑line reversal for life‑threatening respiratory depression.",

Supply is often misrepresented: pressed “mescaline pills” and microdots are almost never true mescaline and are frequently LSD/DOx/2C-x/MDxx—use reagent testing and, when possible, a lab drug-checking service. Dose by weight with a calibrated mg scale and know the salt form (HCl vs sulfate/citrate) before comparing numbers. Combining with MAOIs (irreversible) or lithium has a poor safety record and should be avoided; RIMAs markedly potentiate and alter character and nausea. Set, setting, and sitter matter: plan 12–16+ hours of downtime, hydrate, avoid heat stress, and have a calm space prepared. Tolerance to classic psychedelics develops quickly and crosses between mescaline, LSD, and psilocin; spacing sessions by 1–2+ weeks helps restore sensitivity. Avoid driving, swimming, or hazardous activities until fully baseline the next day. For severe anxiety or dysphoria, reduce stimulation (lights/sounds), breathe slowly, change environment, and seek support; medical management may involve benzodiazepines but that should be clinician-guided.",

    "notes": "- Purity/formulation matter: street meth is almost always the hydrochloride (HCl) salt, which is water-soluble and directly smokable; meth freebase is an oily liquid and uncommon. Do not attempt to base or re-base street crystals; this creates caustic products and adds risks. Salt-to-base potency differs by ~20% (HCl MW ~185.7 vs base 149.2).\n- Half-life and duration vary with urine pH: alkalinization markedly slows renal clearance and can extend both duration and adverse effects; acidification speeds clearance. Intentionally altering body pH to tweak duration is risky and discouraged.\n- Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmia, chest pain) and hyperthermia are leading acute harms; risk escalates with dose, redosing, dehydration, heat, and polydrug stimulant use. Seek urgent care for chest pain, severe headache, or high fever.\n- Neurotoxicity risk increases with high doses, hyperthermia, and prolonged wakefulness; spacing sessions, sleeping, eating, and keeping cool are protective behaviors.\n- Redosing drives binges and insomnia. Plan a cutoff time; dose early in the day; avoid stacking routes (e.g., smoking then IV).\n- Hydration: sip ~250–500 mL/h of water or oral rehydration solution when active/hot; avoid overhydration. Replace electrolytes on long sessions.\n- Oral care: dry mouth (xerostomia) and bruxism increase caries risk. Prefer water over sugary sodas; use sugar-free gum/lozenges for saliva; brush gently before bed; consider fluoride rinse.\n- Insufflation: rotate nostrils; use fine powder; rinse with sterile saline after to reduce irritation and septal damage.\n- Smoking: use heat-control (no direct flame on crystal), avoid sharing pipes/mouthpieces to reduce infection transmission from burns/sores; allow glass to cool to prevent cracks and cuts.\n- Injection: use new sterile equipment every time; filter with a 0.22 μm wheel filter if possible; avoid ‘acidifying’ crystal HCl; rotate sites; never share equipment; watch for signs of infection or endocarditis (fever, chills, new heart murmur).\n- Drug checking: if available, use reagent testing or mail-in lab services. Fentanyl test strips can detect contamination but require high dilution to avoid false positives from concentrated stimulants; test every new batch and carry naloxone where contamination is prevalent.\n- Medicines/supplements: CYP2D6 inhibition (e.g., some antidepressants) can increase active levels; combining with serotonergic or seizure-threshold–lowering drugs (e.g., tramadol) increases risks.\n- Legal status: Schedule II (US) for limited medical uses; illicit supply varies in purity and may include adulterants; never assume any batch is pure.",

Early signs include gait disturbance, hypophonia, and falls; MRI classically shows T1 hyperintensity of the globus pallidus. Redosing pressure is high due to the short duration; spacing doses and setting a firm session cap reduces binge risk and sleep deprivation. Like other stimulants, methcathinone can acutely raise heart rate and blood pressure; those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or arrhythmia risk should avoid use and everyone should avoid strenuous exertion while under the influence. Combining with MAOIs is hazardous (hypertensive crises, hyperthermia) and should be strictly avoided; combining with tramadol or bupropion increases seizure risk. Mixing with alcohol increases dehydration and cardiostress while masking intoxication; with benzodiazepines, sedation can mask stimulant overuse and encourage redosing — treat as a caution-only combination reserved for managing severe agitation. Insufflation is irritating/caustic; use tiny test lines, rotate nostrils, rinse with saline after, and allow mucosa to recover between sessions. Use a precise milligram scale, lab‑verified material when possible, and consider reagent testing/drug checking to rule out substitutions or manganese contamination. Expect a comedown (anxiety, dysphoria, insomnia); nutrition, hydration, and planning sleep ahead of time reduce harm. Frequent use builds tolerance rapidly and can drive dose escalation; spacing sessions (≥1–2 weeks) reduces risk of dependency and persistent mood changes.",

    "notes": "- Co-administration with alcohol can potentiate CNS effects and has been specifically warned to cause 'dose-dumping' with some extended-release formulations (e.g., OROS), rapidly releasing large doses and increasing adverse-event risk; avoid alcohol around dosing, particularly with ER products.\n- Manipulating ER/OROS tablets (crushing, chewing, splitting, perforating) defeats controlled-release, causing unpredictable spikes; use only as designed.\n- MAOI use within 14 days is contraindicated due to severe hypertensive and hyperadrenergic reactions; do not combine.\n- Stimulants including MPH can raise heart rate and blood pressure and have rarely been associated with serious cardiovascular events (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction, sudden death), especially in those with structural heart disease; screening for cardiac risk factors is prudent and non-medical high-dose use increases risk.\n- Insufflating IR tablets increases local harm from binders/fillers (irritation, epistaxis, mucosal injury) and encourages compulsive redosing; community HR sources explicitly advise against snorting due to excipients.\n- Injecting crushed tablets is high-risk: insoluble excipients (e.g., talc) can embolize causing 'Ritalin lung' (panlobular/panacinar emphysema/talcosis) and severe, sometimes irreversible pulmonary damage; IV use also carries blood-borne infection risks.\n- Combining MPH with other pro-convulsant medicines (e.g., bupropion) or with very high stimulant doses can lower seizure threshold; caution and dose minimization reduce risk.\n- Dosing late in the day and redosing in short intervals increases insomnia risk and next-day fatigue; spacing doses and setting a last-dose cutoff helps mitigate this.\n- Oral IR dosing has slower onset and longer total duration than insufflation, which hits faster but wears off quicker; users often report stronger comedown and rebound with faster routes.\n- Alcohol plus stimulants can mask alcohol intoxication and increase cardiovascular strain; even beyond dose-dumping, this pairing raises risk behaviors and toxicity; safer to avoid co-use.\n- Tolerance to subjective euphoria and focus can build quickly with frequent use; spacing use days and avoiding binges reduces tolerance and crash severity (anecdotal but consistent across user communities).\n- If breastfeeding, available data for the active isomer (dexmethylphenidate) suggest low milk levels and low infant exposure; however, non-medical use and high doses are inappropriate during lactation.\n- Extended-release brand systems differ (e.g., OROS vs multi-layer beads), producing different time–concentration curves; switching products can change onset/peak even at the same milligram strength.

    "notes": "Mirogabalin is an α2δ subunit modulator of voltage‑gated calcium channels, not a GABA(A) agonist; expect sedative and ataxic effects from reduced excitatory neurotransmission rather than direct GABAergic action. Combining with opioids or other CNS depressants substantially increases overdose risk due to additive respiratory depression; this pattern has been implicated in European mortality monitoring for gabapentinoids as a class. If an opioid is present during an overdose, naloxone reverses the opioid but not mirogabalin—continued monitoring and supportive breathing are still required. Like other gabapentinoids, abrupt discontinuation after sustained use can precipitate withdrawal (anxiety, insomnia, tremor, nausea; rarely seizures); taper gradually under medical supervision. Dose accumulation occurs in renal impairment—start lower and extend intervals; older adults are more susceptible to dizziness, confusion, and falls. Avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least 6–8 hours after dosing (longer with higher doses or combinations). Peripheral edema and weight gain can occur in this class; monitor if you have cardiovascular or edema‑prone conditions. To reduce harm: use single‑substance sessions, avoid redosing loops, keep hydrated but not excessive, and never mix with alcohol/benzos/“Z‑drugs”. If using around opioids, ensure ready access to naloxone and do not use alone. Store securely to prevent diversion.",

    "notes": "Oxazepam is a 3‑hydroxy benzodiazepine and the active metabolite of diazepam and temazepam; unlike many benzodiazepines it undergoes direct glucuronidation (UGT2B15/UGT2B7/UGT1A9) to an inactive metabolite, so it has fewer CYP‑mediated interactions and is often preferred in hepatic impairment, though sedation/fall risk still applies. The mean elimination half‑life is about 8.2 hours (reported range roughly 4–21 h); onset is slow and variable with a typical Tmax around 3 hours, so avoid redosing for at least several hours to minimize cumulative CNS depression. Combining oxazepam with other depressants—particularly alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, or barbiturates—markedly increases risks of respiratory depression, aspiration, overdose, and death; if an opioid is taken accidentally together, seek medical help and place the person in the recovery position. Co-use with gabapentinoids and sedating antihistamines also heightens sedation and overdose risk; avoid or drastically reduce doses if such combinations cannot be avoided. Do not drive or operate machinery after dosing; psychomotor and cognitive impairment can persist into the next day, especially with higher or repeated doses. In patients with sleep apnea or significant respiratory disease, benzodiazepines can worsen hypoventilation and are generally not recommended. Paradoxical agitation, disinhibition, or irritability can occur—stop use and seek medical guidance if these appear. Abrupt discontinuation after regular use can precipitate benzodiazepine withdrawal (rebound anxiety, insomnia, tremor, and, in severe cases, seizures); taper gradually under medical supervision. Pregnancy and breastfeeding: benzodiazepines cross the placenta and appear in breastmilk; neonatal flaccidity, withdrawal, and respiratory depression are reported—avoid unless clearly indicated by a clinician. In older adults, even therapeutic doses are associated with increased risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and possible long‑term dementia associations; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. Because oxazepam’s absorption is slow and its lipophilicity relatively low, non-oral ROAs provide no safety advantage and may increase harms; stick to oral use as prescribed. Consider dose equivalence cautiously when switching: a rough guide is ~20 mg oxazepam ≈ 10 mg diazepam, but individual responses vary—always reduce and re-titrate when converting.",

Label dosing devices (scoops) are unreliable; a scale is recommended.\n• Avoid dosing late in the day; users commonly report insomnia or sleep disruption when taken in the afternoon or evening.\n• Combining with choline donors can reduce racetam‑associated headaches in some but may also increase stimulation, anxiety, or headaches if choline load is excessive; adjust choline slowly if used.\n• Concurrent use with CNS depressants (opioids, benzodiazepines, sedatives) can increase CNS depression risk per DrugBank’s interaction listings; avoid or use only under medical oversight.\n• Limit stacking with other stimulants (e.g., high caffeine, modafinil) to reduce risk of tachycardia, anxiety, and insomnia; space compounds and test combinations cautiously. General stimulant HR principles apply.\n• Some reports suggest racetams can potentiate MDMA’s acute effects and alter the comedown; given uncertainty and interindividual variability, avoid this combination or proceed only with strong experience and conservative dosing.\n• Pharmacokinetic human data are limited in open sources; treat use in renal impairment, pregnancy, or breastfeeding as higher risk and consider avoidance or medical guidance due to uncertain elimination and lack of safety data. DrugBank lists Oxiracetam as investigational with sparse PK fields.\n• Take with food and adequate hydration to mitigate nausea or GI discomfort reported anecdotally.\n• Do not rely on subjective clarity to judge fitness to drive or operate machinery; stimulant-like effects can mask impairment or cause over‑arousal.

    "notes": "• Combining oxycodone with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, gabapentinoids, GHB) greatly magnifies risks of overdose, respiratory depression, and death; this is a leading driver of fatalities. TripSit and clinical reviews flag opioid+benzo/gaba combos as dangerous; gabapentinoid co-prescription doubles opioid-related mortality in observational data. • CYP3A4 strongly affects oxycodone exposure. Adding an inhibitor (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolides, protease inhibitors, grapefruit) after you’re stable on a dose can acutely raise oxycodone levels and cause overdose; starting/stopping inducers (rifampin/carbamazepine/phenytoin/St. John’s wort) can lower levels or, when stopped, rebound them upward. This warning appears in the oxycodone label summaries (MedGen/NCBI) and DrugBank metabolism section. • CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, some SSRIs/SNRIs) reduce formation of oxymorphone and can change effect profile (sometimes less analgesia but more parent-drug sedation). Use extra caution if adding/stopping these. Label summaries note enhanced effects when 3A4 and 2D6 inhibitors are combined. • Counterfeit “oxycodone/Percocet” tablets are common; drug-checking projects repeatedly find fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, nitazenes (e.g., metonitazene, protonitazepyne), and benzodiazepines (e.g., bromazolam) instead of oxycodone. Use fentanyl test strips, but know they do not detect nitazenes; many onsite FTIR devices also miss <5% content. Laboratory checking where available is safer. • Keep naloxone (or nalmefene) accessible and teach people around you to use it. Naloxone reverses opioid respiratory depression; multiple doses may be required with potent adulterants. Community distribution programs show thousands of overdose reversals. • If you only have acetaminophen-containing products (e.g., Percocet), track total daily APAP from all sources and stay ≤4,000 mg/day to avoid liver injury. Consider a properly performed cold-water extraction (CWE) to reduce APAP before non-medical use; never rely on CWE to make unsafe doses “safe.” • Prefer oral dosing. Avoid injecting or smoking crushed tablets: insoluble binders and tamper-resistant matrices raise risks of emboli and serious tissue/organ harm; TripSit explicitly flags IV use of oxycodone tablets as extremely dangerous. • Do not chew/crush ER products (e.g., OxyContin) for non-medical use: this can release the full dose at once (“dose dumping”) and sharply increase overdose risk. Redose cautiously and leave several hours between doses because sedation/respiratory depression can outlast euphoria. Label summaries and clinical texts warn about this. • When using alone is unavoidable, use tiny test doses, avoid mixing depressants, and arrange a check-in or use an overdose-detection line; know basic rescue breathing. If someone is unresponsive, call emergency services, give naloxone, and provide rescue breathing until help arrives. • Chronic use: constipation is near-universal; hydrate, use fiber/osmotic laxatives as needed. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia can occur; increasing doses may paradoxically worsen pain—seek medical review. • Driving/operating machinery is unsafe while affected. People with sleep apnea, COPD, or on sedatives are at higher risk of nocturnal hypoventilation—start at low doses and avoid co-depressants.",

    "notes": "Phenobarbital is a long-acting barbiturate used primarily as an anticonvulsant; it enhances GABAA-mediated inhibition and also dampens excitatory transmission, producing dose-dependent CNS and respiratory depression. Its elimination half-life averages roughly 79 hours (range ~53–118 h), which means effects can accumulate across days; redosing on the same day or consecutive days markedly increases overdose risk. As a strong inducer of multiple CYP isoenzymes, phenobarbital reduces the efficacy of many medications, notably combined oral contraceptives (risk of unintended pregnancy) and warfarin (risk of subtherapeutic anticoagulation), and can lower levels of other antiepileptics; users should avoid assuming familiar medications behave normally while on phenobarbital. Barbiturates carry a narrow therapeutic index: toxic and even fatal blood concentrations overlap with or lie not far above therapeutic levels, making self-titration hazardous; overdose deaths typically result from respiratory depression compounded by hypotension and coma. Combining with other CNS depressants (opioids, alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, GHB/GBL, sedating antihistamines, carisoprodol) substantially increases the risk of fatal respiratory depression; this risk persists for days because phenobarbital remains in the body long after the subjective effects fade. Phenobarbital is contraindicated in acute or latent porphyria and should be avoided in significant hepatic impairment; it can precipitate porphyric crises via enzyme induction. Chronic use can cause dependence; abrupt cessation after sustained daily use can provoke severe, potentially life-threatening withdrawal (including seizures)—any stop should be medically supervised and slowly tapered. Avoid driving or tasks requiring alertness for at least 24 hours after dosing (longer with higher or repeated doses), as coordination and reaction time are impaired even when one feels “sober.” If phenobarbital has been used with opioids, naloxone reverses only the opioid component—sedation from phenobarbital may persist and requires airway support and monitoring by professionals. Parenteral phenobarbital must be administered by clinicians; nonmedical IV use (especially of tablet formulations) risks immediate apnea/hypotension and catastrophic local injury; intra-arterial and subcutaneous injection are explicitly unsafe. Use in pregnancy is associated with congenital risks; avoid nonmedical exposure during pregnancy and lactation.",

    },
    "notes": "Piracetam is almost entirely renally excreted unchanged; dose accumulation is possible in renal impairment and the drug is dialyzable, so individuals with reduced kidney function should consult a clinician and consider dose reduction. It exhibits antiplatelet and hemorheologic effects (e.g., reduced platelet aggregation; lower fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor levels), so caution is warranted with concurrent anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and around surgeries or active bleeding conditions. Oral bioavailability is near 100% with Tmax around 1 hour (CSF ~5 h), and steady state in about 3 days; acute ‘stimulant-like’ effects are usually mild, with many benefits reported only after several days of regular dosing. Common side effects include nervousness, insomnia, agitation, and headache; taking doses earlier in the day and splitting the total daily amount may reduce sleep disruption. Some users report racetam-associated headaches that improve with ensuring adequate dietary choline or adding a choline source; this is anecdotal and excessive choline can cause GI upset. Clinical use spans cognitive disorders, vertigo, cortical myoclonus, dyslexia, and sickle cell disease, but evidence quality varies by indication and it is not FDA-approved in the United States. High therapeutic doses (e.g., up to 24 g/day) are used for cortical myoclonus under medical supervision; such dosing outside clinical oversight increases the likelihood of adverse effects (e.g., insomnia, agitation) without proven added benefit in healthy users. Piracetam crosses the placenta; safety in pregnancy and lactation is not established—avoid unless prescribed. Because piracetam products are often purchased online in some regions, product quality can vary; use reputable sources and be cautious of mislabeling—general drug checking practices improve safety even when the risk of adulteration is perceived to be low. Do not substitute piracetam for established treatments (e.g., for epilepsy or cognitive disorders) without clinician guidance; rodent data suggest complex interactions with antiepileptics, but clinical anticonvulsant efficacy is limited. Start low, assess individual sensitivity over several days, and avoid combining with strong stimulants until individual effects are known. ",

    "notes": "Standard anaesthetic practice uses continuous infusions of 0.05–0.25 µg kg⁻¹ min⁻¹; analgesia ceases within ~5 min of pump stoppage due to ester hydrolysis. Context-sensitive half-life is ~3–4 min regardless of infusion length. Bolus dosing outside monitored settings is strongly discouraged because apnoea or chest wall rigidity can occur before the syringe is empty. Chest/truncal rigidity with potent opioids is more likely with rapid IV pushes; slow administration and airway support are essential in clinical settings. Metabolism is by nonspecific blood/tissue esterases to an inactive acid; CYP inhibitors are not expected to prolong effect. Remifentanil can produce acute tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, especially after higher doses or abrupt cessation of infusions; expect rebound pain/craving within minutes once stopped. In overdose, prioritize airway/ventilation; give naloxone in small, titrated IV boluses (e.g., 0.04 mg) to restore breathing while minimizing severe withdrawal, and be prepared for re-sedation if longer-acting opioids or other depressants are present. Non-medical IV use carries high risks of hypoxia, infection, and BBVs; if people use regardless, sterile technique, low-dead-space syringes, never using alone, and access to naloxone/overdose response training reduce but do not eliminate risk.",

    "notes": "Key harm-reduction points and rationale: SDX is an orally activated prodrug with low oral bioavailability (~3%) and slow enzymatic conversion; this design aims to reduce rapid spikes in d-MPH and lowers intranasal/IV reinforcement—non-oral misuse is unlikely to enhance effects and may increase harm from excipients. DrugBank PK data support the slow conversion and low SDX bioavailability; intranasal/IV misuse deterrence is an inference consistent with the prodrug model. Cardiovascular screening is important: CNS stimulants can increase BP/HR and, rarely, cause serious events (stroke, MI, sudden death) in predisposed patients; assess personal/family cardiac history and consider baseline vitals before use. Peripheral vasculopathy (e.g., Raynaud’s) is reported with stimulants; keep warm, avoid nicotine, and seek evaluation if finger/toe color changes occur. Stimulants may precipitate or exacerbate psychosis or mania; avoid if unstable psychosis/bipolar and monitor for new hallucinations or mood elevation. Priapism (painful prolonged erections) is a rare but notable risk with methylphenidate-class stimulants; urgent care is required if >4 hours. Co-use with alcohol can increase d-MPH exposure and form ethylphenidate, adding cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity risk; avoid mixing. For sleep, take early in the morning; food does not meaningfully change overall exposure but delays Tmax, which can shift the effect curve later into the day. Appetite and weight loss can occur; maintain nutrition and hydration and consider timing meals around the dose. In youth, chronic stimulant therapy may affect growth trajectories; periodic height/weight checks are recommended (clinical context). Avoid stacking multiple stimulants (including decongestants/energy products) and space dosing to prevent redosing escalations; plan off-days if clinically appropriate to limit tolerance. Never crush/snort/inject contents; beyond low expected efficacy due to prodrug design, excipients and beads can damage tissues or cause emboli if injected. Store securely to prevent diversion and accidental pediatric exposure. Evidence sources: DrugBank serdexmethylphenidate/dexmethylphenidate monographs for PK, cardiovascular/psychiatric warnings, food effects, and metabolism (including ethylphenidate formation); TripSit and community HR resources for general stimulant-mixing cautions; some route-of-abuse deterrence specifics are inferred from the prodrug pharmacology and supported anecdotally by user reports.",

Maintain a 14‑day washout when switching to or from serotonergic antidepressants; extend to 5 weeks after fluoxetine due to its long half-life. Hypertensive crisis (“cheese reaction”) can occur from dietary tyramine or sympathomimetic drugs; earliest sign is often a severe occipital headache, and can progress to chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, confusion, and seizures — seek emergency care immediately. Serotonin syndrome risk is high if combined with serotonergic medicines (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs, clomipramine, MDMA, tramadol, DXM, linezolid, methylene blue); symptoms include agitation, hyperreflexia, clonus, fever, diaphoresis, diarrhea — urgent evaluation is required. Avoid OTC cold/cough products that contain dextromethorphan or decongestants (pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine); many carry a label warning against use within 14 days of an MAOI. Follow a low‑tyramine diet throughout therapy and for 2 weeks after stopping; avoid aged cheeses, cured/fermented meats, soy sauce/miso/yeast extracts, fava beans, and tap/draft beers; packaged spirits in modest amounts still require caution for hypotension/CNS effects. For planned surgery or dental procedures, inform anesthesia providers; some agents (e.g., meperidine, serotonergic antiemetics) are contraindicated, and perioperative plans may need adjustment. Tranylcypromine has a stimulant-like profile and can cause insomnia and orthostatic hypotension; dosing earlier in the day and dividing doses may reduce insomnia and BP swings. Rare hepatotoxicity has been reported; baseline and periodic liver function and blood pressure monitoring are prudent in clinical use. Carry an MAOI alert card/bracelet listing key contraindications (meperidine, DXM, serotonergic antidepressants, sympathomimetics) so emergency staff can avoid dangerous drugs.",

    "notes": "Trazodone is a SARI that at low doses primarily blocks 5‑HT2A/H1/alpha‑1 receptors and is sedating, while at higher antidepressant doses it also meaningfully inhibits the serotonin transporter; this dose‑dependent pharmacology explains why 25–100 mg often helps sleep but does not treat depression without daytime dosing. It should be taken after food when possible to lessen lightheadedness and orthostatic hypotension, a common early adverse effect due to alpha‑1 blockade. Clinically important risks include QT prolongation and rare torsades de pointes; combinations with other QT‑prolonging agents or in patients with cardiac disease/electrolyte derangements warrant extra caution and consideration of ECG monitoring. Priapism is a rare but serious emergency; an erection lasting more than 4 hours or painful erections require immediate ER evaluation; risk may be higher early in treatment and in those with hematologic diseases (e.g., sickle cell) or penile anatomic variants. CNS depression is additive with alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z‑drugs, opioids, and gabapentinoids; combining increases risk of respiratory depression, impaired driving, and falls—avoid or minimize and use the lowest effective doses with planned timing. Serotonin syndrome can occur when combined with MAOIs, linezolid, IV methylene blue, or other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, tramadol, triptans, dextromethorphan, fentanyl, St John’s Wort); observe a 14‑day washout from MAOIs and monitor for agitation, tremor/clonus, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (clarithromycin, azole antifungals, ritonavir) and grapefruit juice can raise trazodone exposure—leading to more sedation, hypotension, and arrhythmia risk—while CYP3A4 inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St John’s Wort) can reduce efficacy. Older adults are more susceptible to hyponatremia/SIADH and orthostatic hypotension; check sodium if confusion, headache, seizures, or falls occur, and consider dose reductions. Hepatic metabolism is primary and rare idiosyncratic liver injury has been reported; obtain baseline LFTs and recheck if clinically indicated or if symptoms (e.g., jaundice, dark urine, pruritus) develop. There are reports of increased INR with warfarin and increased digoxin levels; monitor especially after initiation or dose changes. Screen for bipolar spectrum illness before starting because antidepressant‑induced switching or mania has been reported; discontinue if mania emerges. Avoid driving, cycling, operating machinery, or engaging in safety‑critical tasks until you know your next‑day alertness; next‑morning impairment is more likely with higher doses, interactions, sleep deprivation, or when combined with other depressants. Discontinuation should be gradual to reduce rebound insomnia and withdrawal‑like symptoms (nausea, dysphoria, agitation, paresthesias).",

    "notes": "Do not combine alprazolam with opioids, alcohol, or other sedatives; this combination greatly increases the risk of respiratory depression, coma, and death. A boxed warning applies to the class for opioid co‑use. Alprazolam is primarily metabolized by CYP3A; strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, fluvoxamine) and grapefruit can raise levels markedly; strong inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort) can lower levels and precipitate withdrawal or loss of effect. Street “Xanax” bars are frequently misrepresented; drug‑checking services have repeatedly found potent designer benzodiazepines (e.g., flualprazolam, norflurazepam) or other unexpected actives in tablets sold as alprazolam. Use professional drug checking where available and avoid assuming imprint/appearance equals identity. Do not stop suddenly after repeated dosing; benzodiazepine withdrawal can include seizures and delirium. Tapering should be gradual and medically supervised; flumazenil can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent users and is generally avoided outside specific monitored indications. Alprazolam impairs attention, memory, and coordination; avoid driving or hazardous tasks while affected and after high or interacting doses. Avoid non‑oral routes: crushing tablets for injection/insufflation introduces fillers that can damage tissue and vasculature, and increases risk without added safety. Rapid onset and short/moderate duration encourage redosing and can accelerate tolerance; spacing use and conservative dosing reduce risk.",

    "notes": "GBL is a prodrug rapidly converted to GHB in vivo; relative to GHB it is more potent by volume and has a faster, sharper onset, which increases overdose risk from small mismeasurements. GBL is a skin/mucosal irritant solvent; always dilute in a non‑alcoholic drink before swallowing, avoid contact with eyes/skin, and never inject or insufflate. The dose‑response curve is steep: recreational doses lie close to doses causing unrousable sleep and, at higher levels or when mixed with other depressants, life‑threatening respiratory depression. Redosing too soon causes stacking: wait at least 2 hours between doses and reduce any redose; dopamine‑rebound wakefulness 3–5 hours later can create a strong compulsion to redose but increases risk of dependence. Food reduces/slow s absorption; many HR groups suggest dosing at least 2 hours after eating and avoiding further redose until effects fully plateau. Never combine with alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, barbiturates, Z‑drugs, or other depressants; ketamine with G markedly increases loss of consciousness and breathing problems. If someone becomes unrousable, place them in the recovery position, keep airway clear, monitor breathing, and seek emergency help; do not ‘wake’ them with stimulants or give more substances. Tolerance can develop in days with frequent use; withdrawal may begin within 1–6 hours after the last dose and can escalate to agitation, delirium, tachycardia, and life‑threatening complications — medical supervision is essential for dependent users. Concentration varies by source and bottles; unknown dilution is common — start low (0.3–0.5 mL), measure precisely to 0.1 mL, and label doses/times to avoid mistakes. GHB/GBL may reduce efficacy of some HIV medications; avoid co‑use and consult a clinician if on antiretrovirals. As a solvent, GBL can degrade some plastics; prefer glass (or chemically resistant equipment) for storage/measurement, clearly label, add a food‑safe dye to avoid accidental ingestion, and keep locked away from children/pets. Do not drive or operate machinery; some HR groups advise waiting at least 24 hours after last dose before driving due to residual impairment and stacking.",

    "notes": "• OTC combination products are a major hazard at recreational doses: many syrups/pills include acetaminophen (liver toxicity above therapeutic limits), first-generation antihistamines (anticholinergic delirium, seizure risk), or decongestants (cardiovascular strain). Choose single-ingredient DXM-only products if one insists on use. • DXM effects and safety vary strongly with CYP2D6 genotype and with inhibitors: poor metabolizers or those on potent 2D6 inhibitors can experience unusually long, dysphoric, or toxic effects from doses others tolerate; always test with a low dose and avoid redosing if metabolism is unknown. • Serotonin syndrome is the key life-threatening interaction (triad of autonomic instability, neuromuscular hyperactivity, and altered mental status). Avoid combining DXM with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, tramadol, MDMA, 5-HTP, or St. John’s wort. • Extended-release polistirex (Delsym) is often perceived as ‘half as strong, twice as long’: onset is slower, peaks are broader, and impairment lasts much longer—harder to manage in uncontrolled settings; plan extra recovery time and avoid redosing. • Redosing to ‘stack plateaus’ increases the risk of the so‑called Plateau Sigma pattern (days-long delirium/psychosis-like states); most accounts rate it as extremely unpleasant and risky—avoid intentional Sigma pursuit. • Ataxia and nystagmus (‘robo-walk’) increase fall/accident risk; do not drive or do hazardous activities. Use in a safe, calm setting with a sober sitter at higher plateaus. • Frequent use rapidly builds tolerance and worsens after-effects; spacing uses by multiple weeks reduces cumulative harm. • Chronic heavy DXM HBr use can add significant bromide load; rare cases of bromism present with neuropsychiatric symptoms and spurious hyperchloremia—seek medical care if prolonged confusion/neurologic symptoms occur. • DXM can produce false-positive immunoassay urine screens for PCP (and occasionally other classes); confirmatory GC/MS usually resolves this. Carry medication info if testing is expected. • Avoid products branded Coricidin HBP (‘Triple C’) and other multi-ingredient tablets widely linked to adverse events; the non-DXM actives drive much of the toxicity.",

    "notes": "Identity and purity in the current supply are uncertain; drug checking is strongly advised because mislabeling and unexpected contents in powders/crystals are common in unregulated markets. Start with a low single dose, wait at least 2 hours before considering any redose, and avoid stacking multiple redoses to reduce cardiac and insomnia risks. As with methylphenidate analogs, expect dose‑dependent increases in heart rate, blood pressure, anxiety, jaw tension, and appetite suppression; those with cardiovascular or anxiety disorders should exercise heightened caution. Intranasal use can damage nasal mucosa over time; divide lines finely, use each nostril sparingly, rinse with saline after sessions, and avoid sharing equipment to reduce infection risk. Avoid injecting; if someone is intent on IV use, sterile technique, allergy testing with a tiny fraction dose, and filtration are essential to reduce acute harms from insoluble binders or contaminants. Combining with MAOIs is hazardous due to hypertensive events; avoid this combination entirely. Tramadol plus stimulants can lower seizure threshold and increase serotonin toxicity risk; avoid co‑use and space by many half‑lives if medically required. Stimulant comedowns can be mitigated with sleep hygiene, fluids, electrolytes, gentle nutrition, and time; avoid chasing sleep with high‑dose alcohol or benzodiazepines due to masking/overdose risk. Because potency appears lower than methylphenidate for many, there is a temptation to escalate doses; use a calibrated milligram scale, consider volumetric solutions for accurate micro‑titration, and cap the session length before starting. Insomnia is common after late‑day dosing; avoid use within 8–12 hours of planned sleep. Cross‑tolerance with other phenidates is likely; leave sufficient spacing (several days or longer) between sessions to reduce tolerance and binge‑cycle risk. Little formal human pharmacokinetic/toxicology data exists for 4‑Me‑TMP; absence of data is not evidence of safety—use conservative dosing and vigilant self‑monitoring.",

Discontinue and seek medical care if jaundice, right‑upper‑quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, or marked fatigue occur. • Consider baseline and periodic liver function tests (ALT/AST/bilirubin) if using beyond single occasional trials or more than once weekly; avoid if you have known liver disease. • Avoid stacking with hepatotoxins (heavy alcohol, high/repeated acetaminophen, anabolic steroids, isoniazid, high‑dose vitamin A) during the same week of use. • Onset can be variable; some users report very delayed or stepwise onsets and sudden intensity several hours later. Because of this, do not redose for several hours after an initial dose. • Cardiovascular screening and monitoring similar to other stimulants is prudent: avoid if you have uncontrolled hypertension, significant heart disease, or hyperthyroidism; check blood pressure/heart rate during first trials. • MAOIs are contraindicated with sympathomimetic stimulants due to hypertensive crises—do not combine within 14 days of MAOI use. • Combining with other stimulants or high caffeine increases risks of anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, bruxism, and insomnia; spacing such agents is safer. • Subjective effects are often described as functional stimulation with focus and minimal euphoria; however, some users experience marked anxiety, body load, and dysphoria at doses others find moderate—start low, titrate cautiously. • Prefer oral administration; insufflation appears in anecdotes but offers no safety advantage and may increase adverse effects. • Product authenticity/purity is uncertain in gray markets; reagent references for cyclazodone are sparse. Where possible, use professional GC/MS drug checking; otherwise, avoid multi‑gram purchases and unknown vendors. • Tolerance to stimulation builds with frequent use; spacing use by several days reduces tolerance and cumulative strain on the liver and sleep. • There is no established human half‑life; effects are long enough that late‑day dosing can impair sleep. • Do not combine with decongestants (pseudoephedrine/phenylephrine) or other adrenergics due to additive pressor effects. • Avoid during pregnancy or if trying to conceive; there are no human safety data.",

    "notes": "Identity and data scarcity: CFPP is an obscure halogenated phenylpiperazine with essentially no published human pharmacology; most available information comes from class‑level summaries and older community reports about phenylpiperazines (mCPP, TFMPP, pFPP). Mislabeling/adulteration with piperazines has historically been common in ‘ecstasy’ markets; laboratory drug checking is strongly advised over reagent‑only testing. Reports from mCPP/TFMPP users consistently mention dysphoria, anxiety/panic, nausea, headaches/migraines, thermoregulation changes and a multi‑day ‘hangover’; CFPP likely shares a similar adverse‑effect profile by structural analogy. Serotonergic toxicity can occur when combined with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM, triptans, lithium or other serotonergics—avoid these combinations and seek urgent care if symptoms of serotonin syndrome (agitation, hyperreflexia/clonus, sweating, fever) appear. Phenylpiperazines tend to be more ‘body‑loady’ than euphoric; start with an allergy test (≈1–2 mg), use oral dosing rather than insufflation to reduce local irritation and headache, and avoid redosing—users report that redoses often deepen adverse effects without improving mood. Cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, hypertension) are part of this class; keep cool, take measured breaks from dancing/exertion, sip fluids modestly, and avoid both over‑ and under‑hydration. Because CFPP’s metabolism and half‑life are unknown, allow the full duration plus at least several hours before considering any additional substances. If severe anxiety, tremor or overheating develops, prioritize cooling, rest and consider a benzodiazepine in standard therapeutic doses if not contraindicated; seek medical help for high fever, confusion, chest pain, or persistent vomiting.",

Avoid redosing early; wait at least 2–3 hours before considering more to reduce blackout risk. • Like other benzodiazepines, pyrazolam can cause anterograde amnesia, impaired coordination, and “functionality illusions” (feeling calm while motor skills and judgment are impaired). Do not drive or perform safety-critical tasks. • Combining with other depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, Z‑drugs) greatly increases overdose risk via additive respiratory depression; harm-reduction groups flag benzo–opioid combos as a key driver of poisonings. • Dependence and difficult withdrawal (including seizures) are documented across the new/illicit benzodiazepines category; avoid frequent use and do not stop abruptly after extended use—seek medical guidance for tapering. • Given the variability and mislabeling in this market, volumetric dosing (dissolving a known quantity into a measured volume and dosing by volume) can reduce dose error; TripSit provides a calculator and guidance. • Some community reports claim pyrazolam dissolves readily in water; others note pH-dependent solubility similar to midazolam. Treat solubility claims cautiously; if making solutions, use appropriate solvents/containers and label clearly to prevent accidental ingestion. • Designer/illicit benzodiazepines are sometimes found in opioid samples (“benzo-dope”); if using opioids, assume possible benzo co-exposure and carry naloxone—but note naloxone does not reverse benzodiazepines. • Legal status varies and can change quickly. In the UK and many EU countries, new benzodiazepines including pyrazolam have been targeted by controls; possession/supply may be illegal. • Amnestic effects increase steeply with dose and with combinations; users report blackouts at higher doses or with stacked redoses—consider a trusted sober sitter if experimenting.

Insufflation produces a faster, sharper onset and is commonly described as painful/irritating; oral use is easier to titrate. Product stability varies: exposure to heat, moisture, and oxygen can darken material over time (often towards tan/brown) and partial hydrolysis to psilocin may occur; potency may drift and batches may co‑contain psilocin—test and start low with new supplies. Salt form differences (fumarate vs HCl) change mass‑by‑mass potency only modestly; Erowid’s chemistry notes suggest the typical fumarate is diprotic, making the practical potency gap just a few percent rather than ~25% as sometimes claimed. Community drug‑checking data and reports have found some samples containing both 4‑AcO‑DMT and psilocin, consistent with hydrolysis or co‑formulation. Store airtight, dry, and cold (freezer, desiccant, light‑protected) to slow degradation; avoid long‑term aqueous solutions. Test with Ehrlich’s (indole positive but non‑specific); reagent testing cannot reliably confirm identity—lab analysis is required. Avoid use if you or close family have psychotic or bipolar spectrum disorders; psychedelics can precipitate mania/psychosis in susceptible individuals. Use a sitter, sober environment, and avoid driving for the rest of the day. Because delayed onsets (up to ~2 h) are occasionally reported, do not redose early.",

No authoritative human pharmacology, dose, or impairment data were found in standard HR sources; therefore any self-experimentation should follow microdosing principles, single-variable changes, and long observation intervals. ‘Alt-cannabinoid’ markets have a track record of mislabeling and adulteration (including semi-synthetic cannabinoids and acetate derivatives), which increases risk when buying products labeled as CBL; seek recent full-panel certificates of analysis (COAs) covering potency, residual solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, microbials, and list of diluents. Inhalation risks are elevated for oils and cartridges that may contain non-cannabinoid thickeners; vitamin E acetate adulteration was linked to EVALI cases in 2019, underscoring the need to avoid unknown cutting agents. For those subject to drug testing, note that routine immunoassays target THC metabolites (THC-COOH); full-spectrum hemp/cannabis products marketed as ‘CBL’ can still trigger positives if they contain THC. Because subjective and objective effects are undefined, avoid driving or safety-sensitive tasks until you know your individual response and the product’s true contents.",

    "notes": "Potent NPS stimulant of the pyrrolidinophenone family closely related to α‑PVP/α‑PHP; typically appears as white/off‑white powder or crystals. Batch potency varies widely across vendors and time—use a 0.001 g scale, allergy test (≈1 mg), and incremental titration. Vaporization has the fastest onset and the highest redose liability; many users report compulsive re‑hitting leading to binges, sleep loss, and anxiety spikes. Insufflation is commonly described as notably caustic to nasal mucosa, with increasing irritation and nosebleeds across a session; post‑use saline rinses and spacing lines reduce harm. Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, hypertension), vasoconstriction (cold extremities), hyperthermia with exertion, and severe insomnia are the most common acute risks; avoid heat, hydrate with electrolytes, and rest. If anxious or paranoid, reduce stimulation, cool down, and consider non‑sedating de‑escalation first; if a benzodiazepine is used, avoid redoses and combining with other depressants due to blackout/respiratory risk. Set a pre‑commitment: cap session total and stop‑time to disrupt redosing loops—many binges escalate after the first hour. Adulteration/misrepresentation occurs in street pills/powders; use reagent tests and, where possible, submit samples to a lab‑based drug checking service. Extended binges increase risk of psychosis‑like symptoms; sleep, nutrition, and at least several days of abstinence are protective. Data on human pharmacokinetics is sparse; avoid frequent reuse within the same week to limit tolerance and sleep debt.",

Forum meta-reports consistently place its potency in the sub‑milligram range, with ~0.25 mg often compared to a typical anxiolytic dose range of diazepam; avoid any pressed tablets claiming multi‑milligram doses. Onset is notably slow for a triazolobenzodiazepine (often 1–2 h, sometimes 3 h), which greatly increases redosing risk and blackout potential. Volumetric dosing is essential: dissolve a known amount in a measured volume (e.g., 1 mg in 10–20 mL ethanol/propylene glycol), mix thoroughly, and measure doses with an oral syringe; do not eyeball powders or shave tablets. Wait a full 3–4 hours before considering any redose due to delayed peak and amnesia. Multiple reports describe next‑day impairment lasting well beyond the perceived high; avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least 24 h after dosing. Novel benzodiazepines are widely found in counterfeit ‘Xanax/Valium’-type tablets and in non‑benzo samples; mislabeling and extreme dose variability have been repeatedly documented by drug‑checking and early warning systems — treat unknown tablets/solutions as suspect and test where possible. Combining with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, dissociatives, or gabapentinoids is the main cause of life‑threatening events; treat these as hard contraindications. Naloxone reverses opioids but not benzodiazepines; always prioritize airway and breathing in mixed‑drug poisonings until help arrives. Flumazenil can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent users and should only be given in a clinical setting by trained staff. Because supply may include bromazolam or other benzos mis‑sold as clobromazolam, assume mislabeling until proven otherwise and start at the absolute minimum dose.",

This makes potency, duration, and interaction risks less predictable; drug checking is strongly advised before setting doses. Reports consistently describe rapid onset, short-to-moderate dissociation, and a tendency toward stimulation or restlessness compared with ketamine, which can encourage redosing; pre‑measuring doses and setting a session limit can reduce escalation. Like other arylcyclohexylamines, heavy or frequent use may contribute to ketamine‑type cystitis/uro‑toxicity (urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain); spacing sessions by weeks, staying within conservative doses, and seeking care if urinary symptoms appear are prudent. Combining with CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB) markedly increases blackout, aspiration, and respiratory depression risk; if someone becomes unresponsive, place in the recovery position and seek help. Stimulant combinations increase tachycardia, agitation, and manic states; avoid if possible or keep doses very low with sober monitoring. Because many “FXE” samples are actually 2F‑2′‑oxo‑PCE, and some batches show atypical effects, treat reagent color changes and appearance as non‑diagnostic; only lab‑grade analysis (FTIR/GC‑MS/LC‑MS) can confirm identity. Nasal use can irritate mucosa; use fine powders, alternate nostrils, and rinse with saline post‑session to reduce damage. Very limited pharmacokinetic data exist; assume driving/complex tasks are unsafe for at least a full waking cycle after significant doses.",

    "notes": "Reasoning for harm‑reduction additions (with sources): 1) Mislabeling risk is high: both 3‑FMC and 4‑FMC have been sold as “flephedrone”; this explains divergent reports and mandates allergy testing and lab checking when possible. Bluelight threads explicitly discuss the 3‑FMC/4‑FMC confusion; EMCDDA’s cathinone profile lists 4‑FMC as flephedrone and notes NPS are often mis‑sold. 2) Oral vs insufflated risks: user timelines support short, stacked duration with a harsher crash when snorted; several reports describe painful, irritating drips and long tails after repeat lines. Favor oral to reduce nasal damage and compulsive re‑lining. 3) MAOI combos are dangerous with stimulants/MDMA due to hypertensive crisis and serotonin toxicity; this general rule applies to cathinones as mixed monoamine agents. 4) Tramadol and bupropion lower the seizure threshold; both increase seizure risk when combined with stimulants. Avoid. 5) General stimulant harm reduction applies: overheating and hypertension are risks; stay cool, avoid hot environments, plan rest; do not mix multiple stimulants. 6) Injection/rectal use increases harm and has been linked to outbreaks (HIV/HCV) with cathinones in Europe; avoid injecting and share no equipment. 7) Set dosing boundaries to prevent binges: pre‑measure single dose plus at most one booster; lock away remainder; use a milligram scale; avoid multi‑day runs to reduce comedown intensity and sleep deprivation. 8) Hydration: sip small amounts of electrolyte fluids regularly; avoid overhydration; take cooling breaks. 9) Post‑use care: magnesium for bruxism, gentle nutrition, sleep hygiene; avoid alcohol and strong stimulants on the comedown. 10) Space uses generously: at least 2–4 weeks between sessions to let tolerance and mood normalize. 11) Drug checking: use reagents and, where available, lab drug checking services; branded “legal highs” may contain other cathinones (e.g., MDPV) with very different dose ranges. 12) If chest pain, severe agitation, hyperthermia, or persistent tachycardia occurs, seek urgent care and disclose stimulant use. Sources are cited below. Overall toxicity data for 4‑FMC in humans are sparse; guidance extrapolates from related cathinones and HR best practice.",

    "notes": "Gaboxadol is a direct-acting orthosteric GABA-A agonist that preferentially engages extrasynaptic δ-subunit–containing receptors mediating tonic inhibition; this explains deep sedation with less 'benzo-like' disinhibition and has implications for combinations and reversal strategies. Because it does not act at the benzodiazepine site, flumazenil is unlikely to reverse isolated gaboxadol intoxication; management is supportive with airway monitoring, especially if other depressants were involved. High or repeated doses have been associated anecdotally and in development reports with delirium, hallucinations, and amnesia; therefore, avoid pushing beyond the common range and do not stack redoses in one night. Combination with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, benzodiazepines or Z-drugs substantially increases risk for respiratory depression, loss of consciousness, and aspiration; treat these combinations as high-risk and keep doses markedly lower if abstinence from mixing is not maintained. A structural study confirms binding at α4β3δ extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors, providing mechanistic support for potent slow-wave sleep promotion and pronounced motor incoordination; practice 'safe sleep' (no baths, hazards, or tasks) and plan not to drive until fully recovered. User reports indicate variability in time to peak and next-morning grogginess; if experimenting, take the first dose on a quiet night with supervision available and no next-day obligations. A harm-reduction lab warning has identified mis-sold material contaminated with ibotenic acid (an excitotoxic Amanita alkaloid); obtain from trusted sources, consider analytical testing where available, and do not consume products of uncertain identity. Start with an allergy test (~1 mg), then space trials by several days to gauge sensitivity and tolerance build-up; tolerance to GABAergic sedatives often develops quickly and resolves slowly. As with other strong sedatives, people with sleep apnea, chronic lung disease, or unstable cardiovascular disease are at higher risk from nocturnal hypoventilation; these groups should avoid use.",

    "notes": "Rationale 1 – Mechanism and potency vs CBD: Preclinical studies show CBDA suppresses nausea/vomiting and enhances 5‑HT1A receptor activation at doses orders of magnitude lower than CBD; this supports starting with lower doses and anticipating stronger anti‑nausea/anxiolytic effects at small amounts. This also implies additive effects with other 5‑HT1A agents. Rationale 2 – Decarboxylation and preservation: CBDA is the acidic precursor to CBD and decarboxylates upon heating; avoid smoking/vaping or heating tinctures if the intent is to ingest CBDA specifically. Erowid’s cannabis constituents list and cannabinoid chemistry references support that acidic cannabinoids convert to neutral forms with heat/light/time. Store cool, sealed, and away from light to reduce conversion. Rationale 3 – Product verification: Drug checking programs report mislabeling/adulteration of ‘CBD’ oils with potent semi‑synthetic cannabinoids (e.g., Δ9‑THCP) and other add-ins; insist on a recent third‑party COA that quantifies CBDA/CBD and THC and screens for novel cannabinoids. This reduces risk of unexpected intoxication or positive drug tests. Rationale 4 – Anticoagulants: Multiple case reports show CBD raises INR and necessitates warfarin dose reductions; while CBDA‑specific clinical data are sparse, caution is warranted and INR monitoring advised when initiating or changing CBDA due to possible overlapping CYP pathways. Rationale 5 – Benzodiazepines (clobazam): CBD markedly increases active metabolite N‑desmethylclobazam (via CYP2C19 inhibition), increasing sedation; CBDA’s direct effect here is not established but prudence dictates monitoring and starting low if co‑used. Rationale 6 – Psychedelics: Activation of 5‑HT1A receptors can attenuate certain 5‑HT2A‑mediated psychedelic effects in humans (e.g., buspirone blunting psilocybin visuals). CBDA’s 5‑HT1A activity therefore may modestly dampen some psychedelic phenomenology; keep expectations realistic. Rationale 7 – Stability/formulations: A stabilized analogue (CBDA methyl ester, EPM301) was developed because native CBDA is labile; this underscores the need to minimize heat and prolonged storage if retaining CBDA is desired. Additional HR tips: - Start low (e.g., 2–5 mg oral or 1–2 mg sublingual) and titrate by 2–5 mg steps. - Take with a small amount of dietary fat if oral (may aid absorption, as with other cannabinoids). - Space from sedatives by several hours; avoid combining first doses. - If on interacting meds (warfarin, clobazam, narrow TI drugs), involve a clinician and add monitoring (e.g., INR or drug levels) during the first 2–3 weeks after any CBDA change. - Use products with batch COAs; avoid heating CBDA products (baking/vaping) unless conversion to CBD is intended.",

    "notes": "- Identity and purity vary in the unregulated market; drug checking is strongly recommended. Toronto’s Drug Checking Service and similar services often detect unexpected actives in samples; start with an allergy dose and avoid unknown vendors.\n- Combining dissociatives with CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, opioids, GHB/GBL) greatly increases risks of blackout, airway compromise, and respiratory depression; place anyone unconscious in the recovery position and call emergency services.\n- Frequent/heavy arylcyclohexylamine use is linked to ulcerative cystitis and other urinary tract injury (data strongest for ketamine). Given structural similarity and user reports, apply the same precautions to FXE: minimize frequency, stay well‑hydrated during/after use, and stop if urinary pain/urgency/hematuria emerge.\n- Dissociatives can impair coordination and judgment; sit or lie down during peaks, avoid heights/water, and strictly avoid driving/operating machinery until fully baseline the next day. Ketamine references note sedation and slowed breathing at high doses—caution is extrapolated to FXE.\n- High or prolonged dissociative intoxication can precipitate rhabdomyolysis; seek urgent care if you develop severe muscle pain, dark (tea‑colored) urine, or decreased urination after a session.\n- Insufflation irritates nasal mucosa and encourages redosing. To reduce harm: use separate, clean straws; rotate nostrils; space sessions; and gently rinse with sterile saline 15–30 minutes post‑use. General community HR guidance supports nasal care.\n- Intramuscular use has appeared in community reports but carries additional risks (infection, dosing errors). If someone chooses IM, sterile technique, micron filtration, and accurate volumetric dosing are essential; this is not recommended for novices.\n- Tolerance to dissociatives builds rapidly; even weekly use can markedly blunt effects, encouraging escalation. Long breaks (2–4+ weeks) help reset tolerance.\n- FXE is often described as ketamine‑like with unique nuances; individuals vary widely in sensitivity. Dose conservatively, especially if on serotonergic meds (limited human interaction data for FXE; MXE showed SRI activity).\n- Because FXE is sold as a research chemical, mislabeling/adulteration occur. Visually atypical powders and unexpected effects warrant immediate cessation and testing; some user reports describe anomalous batches. ",

    "notes": "Harm-reduction justifications and key points:\n- Steep dose–response: multiple harm-reduction services and Erowid emphasize that 1–2 mg can markedly change intensity; start low and titrate with an accurate 0.001 g scale or volumetric dosing to mitigate accidental overdosing.\n- Intranasal route is far more potent per mg, has rapid onset, and is notably painful; prefer tiny, well-measured amounts or a volumetric nasal spray; expect a shorter, sharper experience.\n- Typical oral active window is ~4–6 h with an additional 2–4 h of residual stimulation; plan set/setting, nutrition, and sleep accordingly.\n- Tablets/pills labeled as 2C-B vary widely and are sometimes confused with MDMA presses; Swiss drug checking shows many different 2C-B presses around ~13–16 mg and occasional mislabeling or admixture; always reagent-test and, where possible, use professional drug checking.\n- Reagent expectations for 2C‑B: Marquis usually yellow→green within ~10–60 s (may darken later), Mecke/Froehde yellowish; Simon’s negative. Read within the first minute and avoid expired reagents to reduce false interpretations.\n- Avoid MAOIs: historical guides and community data warn of significant potentiation and risk when MAOIs are combined with 2C‑x phenethylamines.\n- Combining with strong stimulants or high alcohol loads increases cardiovascular strain and disinhibition; several harm-reduction guides list tachycardia/hypertension among common physical effects of 2C‑x; avoid driving for the rest of the day.\n- MDMA+2C‑B (\"nexus flip\"): commonly reported but increases total serotonergic/stimulant load; if attempted, reduce each dose and stagger timing (e.g., 2C‑B after MDMA peak) to lower risk of overheating, anxiety, and confusion.\n- SSRIs/SNRIs frequently blunt 2C‑x psychedelic effects; cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics is expected for 1–2 weeks—plan adequate spacing.\n- Safer sniffing: if using intranasally, employ fine powder or isotonic solution, avoid caustic adulterants, and rinse with sterile saline after ~20–30 min to reduce mucosal injury.\n- Set/setting and anxiety: even at ‘party’ doses, acute panic can occur; have a trusted sober sitter and benzodiazepines reserved for emergencies only, at minimal doses due to respiratory/coordination risks.\n- Do not rely on blotters labeled 2C‑B: 2C‑B is typically sold as powder/capsules or pressed pills; blotters often indicate NBOMe/NBOH/DOx which have microgram potency and higher risk profiles.\n- Driving/next-day: performance impairment can persist beyond the subjective offset; harm-reduction leaflets advise waiting until the following day (≥24 h) before driving.\n- Hydration/temperature: mild stimulant properties and environment (e.g., clubs) can raise body temperature—sip water regularly, take cool-down breaks, and avoid overhydration.\n- Testing for identity vs. strength: reagent tests confirm likely class but not dose; only a lab or LC–MS quantitation can confirm mg content—assume variability and calibrate dose with your own product.

    "notes": "Evidence-informed harm reduction points and context: (1) Commercial veterinary products (Telazol/Zoletil) contain equimolar zolazepam with tiletamine. After reconstitution, Telazol solution is strongly acidic (pH ≈2.2–2.8), which helps explain reports of intense nasal burn and potential injection-site irritation; this also means sterile, isotonic preparation and low-volume IM administration reduce local irritation. (2) Clean, pure tiletamine HCl (without zolazepam) has circulated on the grey market; user reports consistently describe substantially higher potency than ketamine by weight and a harsher hangover. (3) Numerous community reports describe coarse tremor, disequilibrium, and lingering neurologic symptoms after repeated dosing over hours–days; spacing sessions and avoiding redosing during the active/offset phase is prudent. (4) Dissociative powders are frequently mis-sold or adulterated; drug checking services routinely find dissociatives sold as other drugs (and vice versa), so reagent tests are insufficient to confirm identity and submitting samples for laboratory GC/MS where available is advised. (5) There is little human pharmacokinetic data for tiletamine; extrapolating animal or vet-product data directly to human non-medical use is unreliable. (6) Reagent reference data for tiletamine are scarce/inconsistent; color tests may be misleading, reinforcing the value of professional analysis. (7) If using any veterinary formulation, account for zolazepam: additive sedation and paradoxical interactions with alcohol and GABAergic drugs are possible and can prolong recovery. (8) As with other dissociatives, avoid combining with CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzos) due to increased risk of loss of airway reflexes, emesis with aspiration, and blackouts.",

Long, sometimes biphasic course (often a very late peak and a very long tail) plus severe amnesia can make redosing hazardous; several users report a strong compulsion to redose—remove access to stash and use a sober sitter. Duration commonly exceeds 24 h; plan no driving, machinery, or safety-critical tasks for at least 36–48 h after dosing. Insomnia and agitation are frequent during offset; avoid self-sedating with alcohol or benzos given additive respiratory/CNS depression—seek medical care if severe. Animal studies show rapid NMDA-antagonist vacuolization with high-dose MK-801; human relevance is uncertain but avoiding heavy doses/combos and spacing sessions remains prudent. Injection (IM) has unique risks (sterility, solvent, pH); multiple anecdotal abscess/necrosis cases—best avoided outside clinical settings. Because enantiomer and salt forms can differ in potency and time-course, do not assume one vendor’s dose applies to another. Use reagent/lab testing where available; misidentified dissociatives circulate. First exposure: ≤0.25 mg single dose, no redose, and allow ≥14 days between trials.

    "notes": "Reasoning for additions and harm-reduction guidance: 1) Dosing and onset: Multiple reputable sources place typical oral doses around 70–150 mg, with a slow 30–90 min onset and long duration. Slow onset encourages risky redosing if people expect MDMA-like timing. Waiting a full 2–3 hours before any redose reduces overdose and adverse-event risk. Sources: Erowid Piperazines Basics; EMCDDA/EUDA risk assessment. 2) Duration/after-effects: Reports consistently describe 6–10 h total duration with insomnia, headache, and stimulation into the next day, which impacts driving and next-day functioning; plan for sleep hygiene and a recovery window. Sources: Erowid Piperazines Basics; DrugWise BZP page. 3) Composition/adulteration: BZP historically appeared in 'party pills' often mixed with TFMPP and/or caffeine; tablets and powders may be mis-sold as MDMA. Use reliable drug checking services when available and don’t assume pill logos indicate MDMA. Sources: EMCDDA/EUDA risk assessment; Erowid BZP vault; DrugWise BZP page. 4) Pharmacology/serotonergic cautions: BZP shows amphetamine-like monoamine releasing effects and evidence of serotonergic activity; combining with SSRIs/SNRIs or other serotonergic agents (especially TFMPP) may increase serotonin syndrome risk. Avoid with MAOIs entirely due to risk of hypertensive crisis. Sources: Erowid neuropharmacology note; EMCDDA/EUDA risk assessment. 5) Cardiovascular/seizure risks: Adverse events include tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, anxiety, headache, nausea and seizures—risks rise with higher doses, heat, dehydration, and polydrug use. People with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, seizure disorders, or significant anxiety should avoid. Sources: EMCDDA/EUDA risk assessment; DrugWise BZP page. 6) Heat, hydration and environment: As a stimulant, BZP can increase body temperature and impair thermoregulation. In hot crowded venues, take cooling breaks, avoid heavy exertion, sip small amounts of water regularly (avoid overhydration), and replace electrolytes. Sources: DrugWise general stimulant cautions. 7) Redosing/spacing: Tolerance to stimulant-like effects can build rapidly across days; spacing use by at least 1–2 weeks reduces compulsive redosing and adverse after-effects. Data are mostly anecdotal but consistent with stimulant patterns. Sources: EMCDDA/EUDA risk assessment; Erowid piperazines content. 8) Alcohol and caffeine: Mixing with alcohol can mask intoxication and stress the heart; caffeine adds to jitteriness, anxiety, and palpitations—keep doses low or avoid. Sources: DrugWise BZP and general stimulant cautions. 9) Legal status: BZP is controlled in many jurisdictions (e.g., EU control measure 2008; US Schedule I). Carrying across borders can lead to prosecution. Sources: EMCDDA/EUDA; Isomerdesign legal summaries. 10) Measuring dose: Effects vary widely; weigh doses with a milligram scale and avoid eyeballing, especially with unknown salt forms (base vs. HCl). PubChem entry confirms HCl salt existence; potency by mass differs between salt and base.",

    "notes": "2C-B-FLY’s oral onset can be slow and variable (20–180+ minutes), so redosing early carries a real overshoot risk; wait at least 3 hours before considering any additional dose. Mislabeling events in 2009 involved Bromo-DragonFLY being sold as 2C-B-FLY; the former is far more potent, longer-lasting, and notably more vasoconstrictive—use reagent tests as a preliminary screen only and prefer GC/MS drug checking when feasible; treat unknown batches with allergy tests (≤1 mg) and conservative titration. Insufflation is commonly reported as extremely painful for 2C-x and specifically for 2C-B-FLY; it tends to shorten duration and roughen the come-up—oral is generally preferred for predictability. As with phenethylamine psychedelics, expect transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure; those with cardiovascular, seizure, or bipolar disorders should avoid or consult a clinician. Salt form affects mass: most references cite the HCl or HBr salts; HBr typically requires roughly 10–20% more mass than HCl for equivalent base—always calculate by salt and weigh accurately. Because of the slow come-up and moderate length, plan set/setting, hydration, and recovery time; avoid combining with stimulants, tramadol, or MAOIs. If effects escalate well past 12 hours with pronounced cold/numb extremities and severe vasoconstriction, suspect misidentification (e.g., Bromo-DragonFLY) and seek medical care; do not redose or take vasoconstrictors. As with all psychedelics, cross-tolerance with other 5-HT2A agonists occurs for several days; spacing experiences by 2+ weeks helps restore baseline sensitivity and reduces compulsive redosing pressure.",

    "notes": "1P‑LSD first appeared circa 2014–2015 and is widely believed to act as a prodrug for LSD: incubation in human serum yields LSD, and subjective time‑course is near‑identical to LSD for most users. Start low because potency equivalence to LSD varies across labs/batches and human data are mixed; community surveys tend to find similar duration and slightly weaker average strength than LSD, but animal HTR potency is lower and inter‑batch variability is large. Blotter dose labels are often imprecise; consider that actual content may deviate ±15–30%. Reagent testing: 1‑acyl lysergamides may show a delayed/weak Ehrlich reaction (pink to light purple over 15–30+ minutes); use a clean ceramic surface, pre‑wet the blotter with a drop of water, and prefer multi‑reagent or laboratory drug checking where available; note that adulteration with tryptamine has been used to fake Ehrlich‑positive results. Redosing the same day is typically inefficient due to rapid 5‑HT2A tolerance; spacing at least 2 weeks between sessions helps restore sensitivity. Avoid mixing with lithium or TCAs due to consistent reports of severe reactions and seizures; if you take prescription psychoactives, consult a clinician. Plan set/setting, have a trusted sober sitter for higher doses, and avoid unsafe environments; impairments can persist into the next day—do not drive or operate machinery until fully baseline. Store blotters airtight, light/heat/oxygen protected (foil, desiccant, cold), to limit degradation and inadvertent hydrolysis to LSD over time. People with a personal or family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder should avoid serotonergic psychedelics due to elevated risk of adverse psychiatric events.",

    "notes": "- Identity and nomenclature: MAL is 3,5-dimethoxy-4-methallyloxyphenethylamine; the methallyl (2‑methylallyl) ether at the 4-position makes it an escaline-family analogue. This specific naming helps distinguish it from mescaline analogues with 3,4,5-trimethoxy patterns. (Source: PiHKAL·info entry and IUPAC listing).\n- Very slow, sometimes deceptive onset (60–120 min) is frequently reported; premature redosing is a common cause of excessive body-load and adverse effects—avoid any redose before 3 hours and consider split-dosing only after prior experience. (Anecdotal consensus across BL/Erowid).\n- Long duration (10–16 h) plus residual after-effects can impact sleep and next-day function; don’t drive, cycle, swim, or operate machinery during and after. Plan an unhurried, temperature‑controlled setting with trusted support.\n- Nausea and GI cramping are common in the first hours; bland pre-meal, ginger/peppermint, and avoiding heavy fats can help. Some find sublingual/insufflation reduces nausea but increases stimulation and local irritation. (Anecdotal).\n- Peripheral stimulation/vasoconstriction and mild hypertension can occur; combining with stimulants (including high-dose caffeine) increases cardiovascular strain—avoid such mixes, especially if you have cardiovascular risk factors. (General HR + TripSit chart rationale).\n- Urinary retention has been repeatedly reported anecdotally with moderate–high doses; inability to void for many hours is a red flag. Avoid anticholinergics (e.g., diphenhydramine), stay hydrated with electrolytes, and seek urgent care if painful retention persists (>6–8 h), if there’s flank pain, or if you feel systemically unwell. Do not self‑medicate with prescription alpha‑blockers without medical supervision. (Anecdotal; community warnings).\n- Salt forms: “MAL fumarate” has appeared in drug checking contexts and can be laid on blotter. Salt form changes mg‑for‑mg potency by mass; if unknown, titrate from the low end and do an allergy test with each new batch.\n- Reagent/drug checking: MAL has been found on blotter, a format often used for long‑acting phenethylamines; always test. Reagents may not be definitive; GC/MS (e.g., DrugsData) or a local service provides confirmation.\n- Allergy test: For any new batch, especially RCs, start with 1–2 mg to screen idiosyncratic reactions, then stepwise titrate on a different day.\n- Mental set: As with other psychedelics, strong alterations in thought and perception occur; having a sober sitter, a plan for anxiety management (breathing, environment control), and avoiding emotionally charged settings reduces risk.\n- Medical cautions: People with BPH/prostate issues, urinary tract problems, uncontrolled hypertension, or significant cardiovascular disease should avoid MAL without medical clearance due to retention and BP risks.\n- Do not mix with lithium (seizure/coma risk reported with psychedelics) or MAOIs (unpredictable potentiation and hypertension risk). Tramadol is risky due to serotonergic and seizure‑threshold effects.\n- Hydration: Sip fluids regularly; add electrolytes if sweating or active. Overhydration can be harmful—avoid chugging large volumes rapidly.\n- Sleep protection: Expect sleep disruption; prepare a dark, quiet space and non-pharmacologic sleep hygiene rather than sedative stacking post‑trip.",

    "notes": "- Clinically documented intoxications (STRIDA, Sweden, 2014 cohort) showed hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and severe cases requiring hospitalization 1–3 days; polysubstance co-use was present in 87% of cases. This underscores the danger of combining with other psychoactives.\n- TripSit and community reports place oral onset at 15–30 minutes with 2–5 hours of main effects and 4–24 hours of after-effects (insomnia, cognitive fog), so plan set/setting and sleep hygiene accordingly.\n- Vaporizing/smoking produces a much steeper onset and is associated with airway irritation and strong compulsion to redose; at least one detailed user report required bronchodilator therapy after vaping. Avoid this ROA if you have any respiratory issues.\n- Identity errors have occurred in the market (e.g., D2PM shipped as diphenidine). Always reagent-test and, where available, use laboratory drug checking; never assume vendor labels are accurate.\n- Combining with CNS depressants (opioids, benzos, alcohol) markedly increases risks of loss of consciousness and aspiration; combination charts and HR wikis flag these as high risk. If emergency sedation is needed (e.g., agitation), medical settings often use benzodiazepines with monitoring; do not attempt to self-sedate.\n- Dissociatives can cause amnesia, ataxia, wandering, and accidents at strong doses. Use a sober sitter, restrict access to hazards, and avoid public spaces. Community threads repeatedly highlight “blank-slate” episodes with impaired recall.\n- Rapid pharmacodynamic tolerance develops (within-session) and cross-tolerance exists across dissociatives. To reduce escalation, space sessions by at least 1–2 weeks and avoid redosing cycles in the same 24 h.\n- Because human pharmacokinetics are poorly characterized, avoid stacking doses; residual effects can linger into the next day. Use precise weighing (≥1 mg resolution) and consider volumetric dosing for sub-20 mg measurements.\n- Nasal use can be harsh; rinsing with sterile saline after insufflation may reduce local irritation per general HR practice. Prefer non-inhalational routes to protect lungs.\n- If you feel unwell (e.g., severe agitation, chest pain, collapsed), seek medical help and be candid about substances taken; hospital teams have treated such cases and monitor for hypertensive crises, arrhythmias, and severe agitation.

    "notes": "• 1cP-LSD (1-cyclopropionyl-lysergic acid diethylamide) is an N‑1 acylated lysergamide that functions as a prodrug to LSD; in vitro human-serum work and animal behavior show conversion to LSD and LSD‑like action. Expect essentially classic LSD pharmacology. [Brandt 2020; community corroboration]\n• Relative potency per microgram is reported as similar to or modestly below LSD; do not assume equi-potency across batches—start low with new sources. [Erowid/Bluelight user reports]\n• Reagent testing: use an indole test (Ehrlich) AND a lysergamide-specific test (Hofmann). Ehrlich can show false-positives on gel tabs or with other indoles (e.g., melatonin); Hofmann should develop blue/purplish for lysergamides over up to ~60 min. Use Marquis/Mecke to help rule out NBOMe/DOx. [Reddit ReagentTesting threads referencing Erowid guidance]\n• Volumetric dosing is strongly recommended for accurate titration with microgram-active drugs. Prepare a measured solution (e.g., in ethanol/water), label clearly, and calculate dose with a volumetric converter. [TripSit]\n• Storage stability: light, heat, oxygen, and moisture accelerate lysergamide degradation. For longer storage, keep blotters/pellets in airtight, lightproof containers with desiccant; refrigerate/freezer storage can extend shelf-life. Warm to room temp before opening to avoid condensation. [Bluelight HR FAQ]\n• Mental health: avoid if history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or uncontrolled severe anxiety. Use sitter, safe setting, and have a de-escalation plan. [General HR consensus]\n• Rescue plan: a benzodiazepine (e.g., 1–2 mg lorazepam or 5–10 mg diazepam) can quell panic, but avoid preloading and mixing with alcohol/other depressants. Seek medical help for chest pain, seizures, or extreme agitation. [HR org guidance]\n• HPPD/lingering visuals are uncommon but documented after LSD-like experiences; risk may rise with frequent/high-dose use and concurrent cannabis. Space sessions, especially after difficult trips. [HR summaries]\n• Driving and tasks requiring full attention: impairment can persist beyond the subjective end of effects; wait at least 24 hours before driving. [Hi‑Ground]\n• Cross-tolerance: strong with LSD and other 5‑HT2A psychedelics; spacing 7–14 days between sessions reduces tolerance and psychological wear. [Bluelight HR FAQ]\n• Legal status varies and changes frequently; in some jurisdictions 1cP‑LSD is controlled or may be treated as an analogue of LSD. Verify locally before purchase/possession/use.

    "notes": "- Naming and supply: MXM is widely discussed as 'Methoxmetamine' or simply 'MXM'; it has also been sold under confusing vendor labels like 'e-Methoxetamine'. Confusion with MXE and other 2-oxo arylcyclohexylamines has occurred; identity verification via reagent tests and, where available, GC/MS drug checking is strongly advised. In some markets, ketamine samples have been found to actually contain other arylcyclohexylamines (e.g., MXE), underscoring the value of checking.\n- ROA efficiency: Early reports consistently describe poor nasal efficacy and irritation with MXM; oral/sublingual routes produce more reliable effects for most users at comparable or lower totals.\n- Onset/plateau: Compared to MXE, MXM typically comes on faster and runs shorter (often ~2–3 h), which can encourage compulsive redosing—pre-weigh doses and set a firm maximum before starting.\n- Tolerance: Dissociative tolerance rises quickly, sometimes after a single strong session, and cross-tolerance with ketamine/MXE/other arylcyclohexylamines is expected. Allow long breaks (≥2 weeks) between sessions to reduce escalation.\n- Bladder/urinary risk: Like other dissociatives, repeated/frequent use is associated with urinary tract problems (urgency, frequency, pain). Stop use and seek medical evaluation if symptoms appear; spacing sessions and maintaining hydration may reduce risk.\n- Mental health: MXM can produce agitation or hypomanic qualities in some users; avoid if you have a history of psychosis or bipolar disorder, and do not combine with stimulants during/after high doses. Ensure a safe environment and sober support if experimenting with unfamiliar doses.\n- IM-specific HR: If choosing IM, use new sterile equipment, sterile water, proper site cleaning (single swipe with alcohol swab, let dry), rotate sites, and consider a 0.22–0.30 µm filter to reduce insoluble particles/endotoxin. Avoid IV due to very rapid onset and loss of motor control.\n- Driving and hazards: Severe impairment of coordination, balance and situational awareness occurs; plan not to drive or operate machinery for at least 24 hours after use.\n- Volumetric dosing and scales: Because redosing and impaired judgment are common on dissociatives, pre-measure doses with a 0.001 g scale; volumetric solutions can improve accuracy and reduce accidental heavy intakes.",

Therefore, always reagent‑test and, where possible, use a laboratory drug‑checking service before dosing.\n- Overheating and over‑hydration are both established risks with serotonergic entactogens. Use cooling/rest breaks; sip fluids regularly but avoid excessive plain water. Prefer electrolyte‑containing drinks or salty snacks to prevent hyponatremia.\n- Serotonergic polypharmacy meaningfully increases the chance of serotonin toxicity. Avoid combinations with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM, and similar agents. This is reflected in TripSit's interaction guidance and community safety lists.\n- Reports with benzofurans (e.g., 5‑MAPB) frequently include jaw tension/bruxism, vasoconstriction, insomnia, and desire to redose; magnesium may reduce jaw clenching for some, but evidence is anecdotal—do not exceed daily limits. Keep doses modest and avoid stacking stimulants.\n- Space sessions widely (commonly ≥4–6 weeks) to reduce mood dips and tolerance; frequent MDMA‑like use worsens after‑effects. This timing is an inference from MDMA harm‑reduction practice and reported hangovers.\n- Insufflation is more likely to cause local irritation and sharp cardiovascular peaks; oral is generally safer/steadier for benzofurans per community experience.\n- During long, hot, or high‑exertion settings (clubs/festivals), plan for cooling, electrolytes, and set dose limits in advance to avoid compulsive redosing.

Naloxone will not reverse non‑opioid sedatives; continue rescue breathing and seek help. [Rationale: 2024–2025 drug checking findings; DrugWise xylazine brief.]\n• Avoid combining with any depressants (alcohol, benzos, Z‑drugs, barbiturates, GHB/GBL) due to strong additive respiratory depression; many fatal overdoses involve these combos. [Rationale: general harm reduction guidance; Erowid opioid cautions.]\n• Ready‑to‑use nasal sprays have been seized on the market; mg/mL concentration may be unknown or uneven. If using, ensure a verified concentration, shake/prime before use, and start with a single measured spray. [Rationale: EUDA reporting of illicit nasal sprays.]\n• Post‑reversal monitoring: subjective effects may fade before the drug clears, especially with high‑potency opioid mixes; monitor for several hours after naloxone to prevent re‑narcotization. [Rationale: general opioid pharmacology and EUDA harm‑reduction focus.]\n• Test what you can: fentanyl test strips do not detect nitazenes; a negative FTS does not prove samples are free of other high‑potency opioids/sedatives. [Rationale: Hi‑Ground nitazene guidance.]\n• Handling safety: avoid aerosolizing powder; minimize skin contact and inhalation exposure when preparing solutions; label all solutions with substance and concentration. [Rationale: EUDA warns of accidental exposure via skin/inhalation; TripSit volumetric dosing practices.]\n• Dependence and tolerance can escalate rapidly; large day‑to‑day dose changes markedly increase overdose risk, especially after short abstinence (‘lost tolerance’). [Rationale: Erowid opioid tolerance warning.]\n• Consider non‑injecting routes if dependent and unable to abstain; if injecting, use sterile equipment, rotate sites, and use sterile water/filters to reduce infection risk. [Rationale: standard HR; aligns with EUDA ‘health and social responses’ guidance.]",

    "notes": "2C-B-AN appears to be an aminonitrile prodrug intended to convert in vivo to 2C-B; community chemistry threads and user reports describe it as such, but there are no formal PK studies, so expect variability in onset and potency. Given the prodrug nature, onset is often slower (~1 h) than 2C-B and redosing too early risks stacking into an overly intense peak several hours later; wait at least 2 hours between doses. Compared with 2C-B, typical oral doses are substantially higher (tens of milligrams), which increases the risk of dosing error; always weigh with a milligram scale and consider volumetric dosing for accuracy. Because 2C-B products are commonly found in pressed pills in nightlife markets and may be confused with MDMA, use lab drug checking where available; 2C-B pills on European services often contain ~10–20 mg and small adulterants have been observed. For 2C-B itself, nasal use is notoriously painful and can cause significant local irritation; for 2C-B-AN, human data by this route are very limited, so oral administration is preferred. Avoid combining with MAOIs or lithium: MAOIs can markedly potentiate phenethylamine psychedelics with hypertension risk, and lithium with classical psychedelics has been associated with seizures and severe adverse reactions in community safety lists. Tramadol lowers seizure threshold and is serotonergic; avoid co-use due to seizure/serotonin toxicity risk. DXM is serotonergic/dissociative and can unpredictably intensify psychedelic effects; harm-reduction lists flag this as a dangerous combination despite some subjective synergy reports. As a little-studied prodrug with a nitrile motif, long-term toxicity and metabolism are not characterized; minimize frequency of use, avoid high/repeated doses, and keep a sober sitter for first trials. Set and setting strongly shape outcomes; avoid if you have a personal or family history of psychosis, and allow at least 2 weeks between psychedelic sessions to reduce tolerance.",

    "notes": "REASONS AND SOURCES FOR EACH HARM-REDUCTION POINT (added fields below follow these justifications):\n- Dose sensitivity and weighing: Multiple HR sources list a narrow active range (roughly 5–20 mg orally) with big effect jumps per few milligrams, so precise weighing is essential. The Drug Users Bible compiles ranges and explicitly notes dose sensitivity; Drugs‑Forum and Erowid archives echo this. Therefore, clear dose brackets and scale/volumetric dosing guidance are warranted.\n- Onset variability and redose risk: TripSit documents oral onset variability, sometimes taking up to 3 hours. Early redosing risks overshooting once the delayed come‑up arrives. So the onset window in duration and a note to wait at least 3 hours before considering any redose are included.\n- Route harms (insufflation): TripSit lists intranasal use with shorter total duration but, in practice, users report severe nasal pain and harsher body load. Because this ROA increases acute adverse effects, I flag it as strongly discouraged and avoid providing numeric doses.\n- Duration planning and after‑effects: Hi‑Ground’s 2C‑x guidance lists 2C‑E total 6–10 h with after‑effects up to 24 h, aligning with user reports; thus the duration curve includes a conservative envelope for planning.\n- Interactions: TripSit’s combination chart and write‑ups consistently flag MAOIs as dangerous with 2C‑x phenethylamines and warn about serotonin/seizure risks with tramadol; community HR threads also warn against lithium with classic psychedelics. Accordingly, MAOIs, tramadol, and lithium are set to “dangerous”, while DXM and stimulants are “unsafe,” and SSRIs, alcohol, cannabis, and benzos are placed under “caution.”\n- Reagent testing and misrepresentation risk: To reduce the risk of misidentified materials (e.g., 2C‑x being sold as MDMA or vice versa), I added explicit reagent expectations for 2C‑E (Marquis: no reaction; Mandelin: yellow/green; Mecke: brown) sourced from Drugs‑Forum’s reagent table. Saferparty’s alerts show 2C‑x pills mis-sold as MDMA, underscoring the need for multi‑reagent testing.\n- Volumetric dosing feasibility and solution stability: TripSit notes ~50 mg/mL aqueous solubility and reasonable solution stability for 2C‑E HCl, but crystallization can occur below room temperature—supporting advice to use dilute solutions, label clearly, and store at room temp away from light.\n- Set/setting and mental intensity: TripSit emphasizes 2C‑E’s heavy body load and strong visuals; prudent advice includes calm set/setting, sitter for higher doses, and avoiding crowded/overstimulating contexts for inexperienced users.\n- Driving/operating machinery: Hi‑Ground recommends not driving for at least 24 hours after 2C‑x use; included under practical safety.\n- Tolerance spacing: Community consensus for 5‑HT2A psychedelics suggests noticeable tolerance for days and near‑baseline by 1–2 weeks; I preserved your existing tolerance windows and note cross‑tolerance to other psychedelics. Data quality here is anecdotal; users should allow ample time between sessions.\n\nAPPLIED HARM-REDUCTION DETAILS (reflected in the JSON fields): 2C‑E often produces stronger body load than some other 2C‑x; effects escalate steeply with dose, so start low and avoid redosing during the first 3 hours. Use a calibrated 0.001 g scale or volumetric dosing to avoid mis-measurement; 2C‑E HCl dissolves in water (approx. ≤50 mg/mL) but can recrystallize if chilled. Always multi‑test unknown samples with reagents; expected 2C‑E reactions include Marquis: no reaction, Mecke: brown, Mandelin: yellow/green—reagents do not confirm purity or dose. Be aware that 2C‑x tablets are sometimes mis‑sold as MDMA; strong set/setting control and a trusted sober sitter are recommended for higher doses. Avoid MAOIs, lithium, and tramadol; avoid combining with other stimulants or DXM; SSRIs may blunt effects; cannabis can potentiate visuals and anxiety; alcohol adds nausea/dehydration and impairs judgment. Insufflation is strongly discouraged due to severe nasal pain and spikier adverse effects. Maintain moderate ambient temperature, sip water regularly (not excessively), and avoid driving for at least 24 hours post‑use. Those with cardiovascular disease, seizure history, or severe anxiety should avoid use or seek medical advice.",

    "notes": "Bromazepam is a prescription benzodiazepine anxiolytic that positively modulates GABA-A receptors; it has an oral Tmax of about 1–4 hours and an elimination half-life around 10–20 hours, with an active metabolite (3-hydroxybromazepam). Using it with other CNS depressants (notably alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL) markedly increases risk of profound sedation and respiratory depression; this combination is overrepresented in overdose data and should be avoided. Co-use with gabapentinoids or Z‑drugs adds sedation and psychomotor impairment; avoid or minimize doses and separate timing if medically unavoidable. Benzodiazepines impair driving and operating machinery; next‑day impairment can persist even when you ‘feel fine’, especially after night dosing or higher doses—do not drive within at least 8–12 hours of a strong dose. Older adults are more sensitive and have slower clearance, increasing falls, fractures, and confusion; doses should be lower and durations shorter. Dependence can develop with weeks of regular use; never stop suddenly after repeated use—taper gradually under medical supervision to avoid severe withdrawal, including seizures. Flumazenil can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent or mixed‑overdose settings; its use requires specialist oversight. Avoid in severe respiratory disease, significant hepatic impairment, sleep apnea, or a history of substance use disorder unless closely supervised. In pregnancy or breastfeeding, benzodiazepines are generally avoided unless necessary; if dependent during pregnancy, guidelines favor gradual dose reduction using long‑acting benzodiazepines under specialist care rather than abrupt cessation. Illicit markets in Europe and elsewhere have widespread counterfeit benzodiazepine tablets containing potent ‘designer’ benzos or even synthetic opioids; only use medicine from a verified prescription supply to reduce poisoning risk. Anterograde amnesia, disinhibition, and paradoxical agitation can occur; take initial test doses in a safe setting and avoid decisions, conflict, or public settings while affected.",

    "notes": "Harm-reduction justifications and updates (see citations): 1) Prodrug/active metabolite: Approximately 30% of a given dose is metabolized to phenmetrazine, which contributes to both clinical effect and abuse potential. Individuals with higher conversion may experience stronger effects and be more prone to redosing. This underlies the need for cautious titration and avoidance of tampering with ER products. 2) Half-life and accumulation: DrugBank reports an apparent elimination half-life of 19–24 hours. Even if the subjective effect window is shorter (IR ~4–6 h; ER ~8–12 h), late-day dosing increases insomnia risk and next-day stimulation; spacing doses and avoiding evening dosing reduces sleep disruption. 3) Food interaction: Take 1 hour before meals; food can delay absorption and blunt peak, which can lead to premature or excessive redosing. 4) Short-term only: Indicated as a short-term adjunct (‘a few weeks’) to caloric restriction; tachyphylaxis/tolerance is expected with ongoing daily use, so extended continuous use raises risks with diminishing benefit. 5) Renal elimination and urinary pH: The drug and its metabolites are primarily renally excreted. Urinary alkalinization (e.g., acetazolamide, bicarbonate) can decrease excretion and raise plasma levels; urinary acidification has the opposite effect. Avoid deliberate pH manipulation. 6) MAOI combinations are contraindicated: MAOIs combined with sympathomimetic amines can precipitate hypertensive crises; this extends to linezolid and methylene blue due to MAOI properties. Maintain at least a 14‑day washout from MAOIs before/after use. 7) Cardiovascular screening: Avoid use with cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, or glaucoma; monitor BP/HR during use. 8) ER tampering and non-oral routes: Extended-release beads are not for crushing or insufflation; tampering defeats controlled release and increases overdose and adverse event risk. The prodrug still requires metabolism; non-oral misuse adds harm without reliable benefit. 9) Heat, hydration, and exertion: Stimulants increase heat production and reduce appetite/thirst awareness; maintain hydration and avoid strenuous exercise/sauna/heat exposure on dose days. 10) Sleep and mental health: Plan dosing early; do not redose late to chase appetite suppression. Stimulant use can exacerbate anxiety or precipitate agitation; discontinue and seek care for chest pain, dyspnea, severe headache, confusion, or hallucinations.",

    "notes": "3‑CAF is a positional isomer of the neurotoxic para‑chloroamphetamine (PCA); animal literature on PCA shows profound, long‑lasting serotonergic depletion, hence caution is warranted when experimenting with any chloro‑substituted amphetamine despite sparse human data on 3‑CAF. Human use reports for 3‑CAF are scarce; subjective effects are described as ‘MDMA‑lite’ empathy plus typical amphetamine stimulation with relatively clean headspace. Because of monoamine release, hyperthermia, jaw clenching/bruxism, tachycardia and insomnia are common at higher doses; plan cool‑down breaks and avoid hot, crowded venues. Hydration should be moderate and include electrolytes (e.g., ~250–500 mL per hour while dancing, less at rest); over‑hydration can cause hyponatremia—sip rather than chug and include salts. Due to overlapping serotonergic mechanisms, combinations with MAOIs, DXM, tramadol, lithium, triptans, St John’s wort, 5‑HTP or other serotonergic releasers greatly increase serotonin syndrome risk; stop use and seek medical help if clonus, agitation, hyperthermia, or confusion occur. Many amphetamines (and MDMA) are CYP2D6 substrates; potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion) may increase exposure and side‑effects—dose conservatively and avoid redosing. Reagent tests cannot reliably distinguish positional isomers; GC/MS‑based drug checking is strongly recommended to exclude para‑chloroamphetamines (PCA/4‑CMA) which have been reported in the market and are strongly serotonergic‑neurotoxic. Space sessions by at least 4 weeks to limit tolerance and potential serotonergic stress; avoid multi‑day binges and sleep deprivation. Always weigh doses on a 0.001 g (milligram) scale; consider an initial 1–2 mg allergy test due to unknown individual sensitivity. Avoid driving/heavy machinery during effects and for several hours after due to residual stimulation and sleep loss.",

    "notes": "• Unconfirmed/phantom status: 2C‑BZ appears on community “unconfirmed NPS” lists, with no widely published analytical confirmations. Treat any sample labeled “2C‑BZ” as suspect until GC‑MS/LC‑MS confirms identity. Color reagents/FTIR cannot reliably distinguish rare analogues or positional isomers; only laboratory mass spectrometry can. • Mislabeling risk is non‑trivial: Dutch drug‑checking alerts have found pills sold as 2C‑B that instead contained a positional isomer (4,5‑dimethoxy‑2‑bromophenethylamine). Assume similar risks for anything marketed as “2C‑BZ”. • Use professional drug‑checking where available. Lab services (e.g., DrugsData) and municipal drug‑checking programs can confirm contents; reports emphasize both the value and limits of FTIR/reagents versus GC‑MS/HR‑LC‑MS. • Potency may be in the single‑digit milligram range according to scattered reports; overdose is plausible if the product is actually a different, more potent compound (e.g., NBOMe/DOx). Employ allergy testing (≤1 mg) and volumetric dosing; wait at least 2–3 hours before redosing due to variable phenethylamine onsets. • Expect typical 2C‑x adverse effects: stimulation, vasoconstriction, jaw tension, nausea. Avoid stacking with other stimulants or pressors; monitor hydration and body temperature in warm environments. • Antidepressant co‑administration: SSRIs/SNRIs often blunt psychedelic effects; MAOIs are a red‑flag combination with 2C‑x phenethylamines. Tramadol and DXM are riskier due to seizure and serotonin‑toxicity potential. • Because many “2C‑BZ” samples may be misidentified 2C‑x/DOx/NBOMe, avoid non‑oral routes; insufflation especially increases hazard with unknown potency and adulterants.",

It is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam, which is glucuronidated and renally eliminated; inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolides, protease inhibitors) and grapefruit can markedly increase sedation and duration, while inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) can reduce effects. Profound respiratory depression, apnea, hypotension, and coma can occur, especially with opioids, alcohol, or other depressants; parenteral use should only occur with continuous monitoring and immediate access to airway/resuscitation equipment. Anterograde amnesia is prominent and may cause blackouts and hazardous redosing; ensure precise measurement, avoid mixing with alcohol, and have a trusted sober person if sedated. Paradoxical agitation, disinhibition, or aggression can occur, particularly in those with alcohol misuse history, psychiatric comorbidity, or at high doses. Older adults, those with hepatic dysfunction, heart failure, or renal impairment are at increased risk of prolonged sedation and adverse events due to reduced clearance and active metabolite accumulation. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided until fully alert; residual psychomotor impairment can outlast perceived sedation. Abrupt discontinuation after repeated use can precipitate severe withdrawal (including seizures); gradual medical tapering is essential for dependent individuals. Flumazenil can reverse benzodiazepine effects but is contraindicated in many mixed overdoses and in benzodiazepine dependence due to seizure risk; emergency medical care and supportive airway management are first-line in suspected overdose.",

    "notes": "Etizolam is prescribed in Japan and India under brand names like Depas, Pasaden, Etilaam, Etizola, and Etizest, but is unapproved in many other countries; in unregulated markets it often appears as pressed tablets or powders of uncertain dose. Counterfeit 'benzo' tablets and blister packs may contain etizolam or other designer benzodiazepines; use drug checking services when possible and do not assume branding equals content. Compared dose-for-dose, 1 mg etizolam is commonly estimated around 10 mg diazepam in anxiolytic/sedative effect; individual response varies, so start low to avoid blackouts. Onset is relatively fast (roughly 10–40 minutes), and redosing during the come-up markedly increases the risk of amnesia, disinhibition, accidents, and respiratory depression, especially if other depressants are onboard. As a CYP3A4 substrate, etizolam’s levels can be increased by potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., some azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, fluvoxamine) and reduced by inducers (e.g., carbamazepine); this can unpredictably strengthen or weaken effects. Mixing with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, or Z‑drugs greatly raises overdose risk (compounded sedation, hypoventilation, aspiration); avoid concurrent use and seek help immediately if someone cannot be roused or breathes slowly or irregularly. In several drug checking datasets, benzo-adulterants, including etizolam, appear in expected-fentanyl samples—be vigilant if using opioids, as combined depressants drive severe poisonings. Withdrawal after sustained or high-dose use can produce severe rebound anxiety, insomnia, tremor, and seizures; never abruptly stop after regular use—medical supervision and gradual tapering are strongly advised. Driving or operating machinery is unsafe while under the influence and can remain unsafe the next morning because of residual sedation and psychomotor impairment. Volumetric dosing (diluting a known small mass into a measured volume) reduces dosing error with powders/solutions; avoid eyeballing or 'drops' from unknown-concentration liquids. Intranasal and especially injection routes are discouraged due to poor solubility, binders, infection risk, and unpredictable kinetics—oral or sublingual are the least risky non-medical routes. Packaging and appearance are unreliable indicators of content; use reagent tests and, where available, GC/MS drug checking to verify. Store powders/solutions cool, dry, and protected from light to limit degradation, and keep all benzodiazepines secured to prevent accidental pediatric/naïve exposure.",

    "notes": "• Prazepam is a long‑acting benzodiazepine prodrug whose primary active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam (nordazepam), has an extremely long and variable half‑life; with repeated dosing, effects and impairment can accumulate across days. Plan doses conservatively and avoid redosing within the same day unless fully assessed for residual sedation. Sources: DrugBank half‑life and CYP3A4 substrate listing; TripSit/Bluelight tables.\n• Mixing benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, Z‑drugs) markedly increases the risk of fatal respiratory depression, blackout, and accidental injury; this combination drives a large share of drug‑related deaths. If any depressant has been used, skip further benzodiazepines and never ‘stack’ them to sleep. Sources: TripSit benzodiazepine harm‑reduction page; Erowid benzo caution.\n• Grapefruit and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can raise prazepam/nordazepam exposure; DrugBank explicitly lists ‘avoid grapefruit’ and categorizes prazepam as a CYP3A4 substrate. Avoid grapefruit juice/products during use and for at least 48–72 h around dosing. Source: DrugBank food interactions/CYP3A4 substrate category.\n• Contraindications and cautions include severe hepatic insufficiency (risk of encephalopathy), severe respiratory insufficiency, and sleep apnoea; start at reduced doses and titrate slowly in older or debilitated adults. Source: product‑style monograph reproduced on Drugs‑Forum.\n• Therapeutic courses should be as short as possible (commonly ≤8–12 weeks including taper). Physical dependence can develop within weeks; abrupt cessation may precipitate severe withdrawal (anxiety rebound, agitation, seizures) and should be avoided. Taper gradually under supervision. Sources: Drugs‑Forum monograph; TripSit warnings that benzo withdrawal can be fatal.\n• Driving and hazardous tasks: next‑day cognitive/motor impairment is common with long‑acting benzodiazepines. Do not drive or operate machinery during acute effects, after dose increases, or the morning after evening dosing—especially with polydrug use or sleep debt. Source: TripSit HR page (explicit ‘inability to drive’).\n• Dose equivalence varies between tables; a commonly cited range is prazepam 10–20 mg ≈ diazepam 10 mg, with one clinical compilation listing 15 mg ≈ 10 mg diazepam. Use equivalence only as rough guidance when switching, then cross‑titrate carefully. Sources: TripSit benzo table; Bluelight equivalency post.\n• Caffeine can subjectively mask sedation without restoring psychomotor performance; DrugBank lists ‘limit caffeine’. Avoid using stimulants to ‘offset’ benzo sedation; this increases risk‑taking while still impaired. Source: DrugBank food interactions; general benzo HR consensus.\n• Paradoxical agitation, disinhibition, and anterograde amnesia can occur, especially at higher doses, in children/older adults, or with alcohol. If paradoxical reactions emerge, discontinue and seek medical guidance. Sources: Drugs‑Forum monograph; Erowid benzo pages.",

    "notes": "Diclazepam is a long-acting designer benzodiazepine (Roche code Ro5‑3448) that metabolises to delorazepam, lorazepam and lormetazepam; these active metabolites extend impairment and drug-test detection windows beyond the parent half-life. In serum, parent drug may be detectable to ~4 days and delorazepam up to ~10 days; urine windows can be longer. Do not drive or operate machinery the day after dosing if any residual sedation is felt. Dosing in unregulated markets is highly variable; analytical work found nominal “1 mg” tablets actually contained ~0.59–1.39 mg (median ~0.95 mg). Treat all products as potentially mislabelled and use drug checking when possible. The onset can feel subtle for the first hours; avoid redosing to “chase” effects—accumulation leads to blackouts and risky disinhibition. Combining with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, barbiturates) markedly increases the risk of respiratory depression, loss of consciousness and aspiration; this combination is strongly discouraged. Tramadol with benzodiazepines is flagged as dangerous (sedation, seizure risk); place anyone who becomes unresponsive in the recovery position and call emergency services. Because diclazepam converts to prescribed benzodiazepines, expect positive immunoassay/confirmatory tests for benzos (including lorazepam/delorazepam) for days after use. RC benzodiazepines are frequently mis-sold or cross-contaminated (e.g., bromazolam or norflurazepam in “alprazolam” tablets), underscoring the value of drug checking and cautious test dosing. Avoid abrupt cessation after repeated use; seek medical support for a gradual taper using a longer-acting benzodiazepine if needed. If preparing solutions for accurate low dosing, use a known solvent and concentration (volumetric dosing) and label clearly; never “eyeball” doses. ",

    "notes": "• Phenazepam is a long‑acting benzodiazepine; TripSit’s benzo table lists an approximate 60 h half‑life, meaning effects and impairment can persist into the following days and accumulate with redosing. Plan doses with a multi‑day horizon and avoid daily use. • Relative potency is high: TripSit lists ~1 mg phenazepam ≈ 10 mg diazepam orally. Start at the low end (0.5–1 mg) and reassess after full onset; do not assume diazepam-like margins. • Because it is active at sub‑milligram to low‑milligram levels, eyeballing powder routinely leads to blackouts and multi‑day amnesia; use a 0.001 g scale and volumetric dosing. Numerous community harm‑reduction threads document severe consequences from mismeasurement. • Onset can be slow (up to 1–1.5 h or longer); redosing before the first dose peaks is a frequent cause of overdose and prolonged blackout. Wait several hours before considering any additional dose. • Avoid insufflation and injection: phenazepam is poorly water‑soluble and reports describe unreliable absorption and delayed effects by non‑oral routes, compounding overdose risk. • Polysubstance risk is high: combining benzodiazepines with alcohol, GHB/GBL, opioids, or tramadol markedly increases sedation and respiratory‑depression risk; if someone becomes unresponsive, place them in the recovery position and call emergency services. Do not attempt home reversal. • Counterfeit or mislabelled tablets are common in illicit markets (e.g., “Xanax/Valium” pressed with other benzos); use drug checking where available and be prepared for unexpected strength or different substances. • Benzodiazepine withdrawal can be severe and potentially life‑threatening; do not abruptly stop after extended or high‑dose use. Seek medical support for a gradual taper. (General benzo harm‑reduction guidance.) • Long half‑life plus amnesia increases risk of unsafe behaviors (driving, online purchases, interpersonal conflict) during multi‑day blackouts; secure access to the supply, log dose/time, and enlist a trusted sober person if needed. Community reports repeatedly describe multi‑day blackouts. • Cross‑tolerance with other benzodiazepines is expected; those with existing benzo tolerance may perceive little effect at low doses but still accrue impairment and dependence. • In some regions, benzodiazepines appear in opioid supplies (e.g., bromazolam/nordiazepam found in checked fentanyl samples), increasing overdose risk; test supplies and carry naloxone (note: naloxone does not reverse benzodiazepines).

    "notes": "• N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite, has a mean half-life of ~71–82 hours (longer than parent), causing accumulation, next-day sedation, and prolonged impairment with repeated dosing; effects are markedly higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.\n• Cannabidiol (CBD) significantly increases clobazam exposure (~60%±80%) and increases N-desmethylclobazam by roughly 3–5×, frequently causing excessive sedation; dose reductions and monitoring are recommended when combined.\n• Combining benzodiazepines with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, Z‑drugs, or gabapentinoids greatly elevates risk of respiratory depression, aspiration, blackouts, and death; avoid such combinations. Community HR charts and clinical warnings align on high risk.\n• Alcohol specifically increases clobazam absorption by about 50%, further intensifying CNS depression beyond simple additivity.\n• Stiripentol (for Dravet/LGS adjunct therapy) inhibits CYPs and disproportionately raises norclobazam levels; adverse effects often resolve after reducing clobazam dose.\n• Avoid abrupt discontinuation after regular use; benzodiazepine withdrawal can include seizures. Gradual tapers are recommended; clinical programs commonly use 10–25% dose reductions every 2–3 weeks, individualized to symptoms.\n• December 2023 FDA alert identified rare but severe DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) with clobazam; seek urgent care for rash with fever or systemic symptoms.\n• Next‑day driving and fall risk persist, especially in older adults, those with hepatic/respiratory disease, and with polypharmacy; plan no driving or high‑risk tasks until fully unimpaired.\n• Metabolism: clobazam is mainly N‑demethylated by CYP3A4 (also 2C19/2B6) to N‑desmethylclobazam, which is cleared predominantly by CYP2C19; inhibitors/inducers of these enzymes materially change exposure.\n• Pregnancy and neonatal risk: benzodiazepines cross the placenta and can cause neonatal sedation or withdrawal; both clobazam and its metabolite are present in breast milk — weigh risks/benefits and monitor infants if exposed.

Avoid alcohol for the entire night when brotizolam is used.\n• Co-use with opioids (including tramadol and methadone) or other depressants (GHB/GBL, barbiturates, sedating antihistamines) is a leading cause of life-threatening respiratory depression; treat such combos as dangerous.\n• Metabolized primarily via CYP3A pathways; strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, grapefruit) can raise brotizolam exposure; inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin) can reduce effects. If unavoidable, lower doses and extra spacing are prudent.\n• Onset is often ~15–30 minutes with peak around 1 hour; next-morning impairment of reaction time and tracking can persist, especially at higher doses or with alcohol. Do not drive or operate machinery until you feel fully alert the next day.\n• In liver impairment, elimination can be prolonged (reports up to ~13 h). Elderly or debilitated patients should start at 0.125 mg or lower.\n• Tolerance to hypnotic effects can emerge within 1–2 weeks of nightly use; dependence can form with regular use. Limit continuous use to the shortest possible period and avoid unplanned escalations.\n• Do not stop abruptly after repeated use; taper gradually to reduce rebound insomnia, anxiety, and seizure risk.\n• Use pharmaceutical product where possible. If handling non‑RX powders or liquids, employ calibrated scales and consider volumetric dosing for sub‑milligram accuracy to prevent accidental overdosing.\n• Contraindications parallel benzodiazepines: severe respiratory disease, significant hepatic dysfunction, pregnancy/lactation, and narrow‑angle glaucoma warrant avoidance unless directed by a clinician.

Avoid co-use and beware delayed toxicity if alcohol was consumed earlier in the day.\n- Fentanyl and other potent opioids have been repeatedly detected in white powders sold as cocaine in some regions; this has caused clusters of opioid overdoses among stimulant users. Never assume stimulant-only; avoid mixing with opioids, carry naloxone where legal, and test if drug checking is available.\n- Levamisole, phenacetin, local anesthetics (lidocaine/procaine/benzocaine), and caffeine are common adulterants. Levamisole can cause agranulocytosis and vasculitis; seek medical care for fevers, mouth sores, or skin lesions. Drug checking services frequently report these cuts.\n- Snorting care: finely crush, use your own clean straw or single-use tool, rinse with sterile/saline water before and after, rotate nostrils, and take breaks to reduce septal damage and infections, including BBV transmission via microbleeds. Avoid banknotes.\n- High cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, hypertension, vasospasm) and overheating are key acute risks. Avoid strenuous activity/overheating, especially during binges; seek urgent care for chest pain, severe headache, confusion, or hyperthermia. Clinical guidance emphasizes external cooling and supportive care for toxicity.\n- Beta-blockers: do not self-medicate. The old warning about “unopposed alpha” is debated; mixed alpha/beta agents (e.g., labetalol) are used in clinical settings, but nonselective beta-blockers can be problematic. If prescribed beta-blockers, discuss stimulant use with a clinician.\n- Serotonergic medicines (SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, MAOIs) can increase risk of serotonin toxicity; MAOIs are particularly hazardous with stimulants. Treat all serotonergic combinations as higher risk and avoid MAOIs entirely.\n- IV use markedly increases risk of arrhythmia, infection, and overdose. If injecting, sterile equipment, sterile water, skin cleaning, and safe disposal are essential; consider alternative routes to reduce harm.\n- Smoking applies to crack/freebase only; use proper glass stems and heat-resistant screens to reduce burns and inhalation of toxic plastics. Avoid plastic pens/foil. HR orgs advise dedicated safer-smoking equipment.\n- Sleep loss and repeated redosing amplify anxiety/paranoia and crash severity. Plan limits for dose/stop time, hydrate with modest fluids and electrolytes, eat light food, and schedule recovery sleep.\n- Pregnancy/breastfeeding: cocaine passes into breast milk and has caused infant toxicity; complete avoidance is advised.\n- Mixing with ketamine is increasingly reported in nightlife settings; the combination can complicate emergencies and adds cardiovascular and dissociative risks—treat as unsafe.

    "notes": "Chlordiazepoxide has a long elimination time and produces active metabolites (including desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam), so effects and impairment can persist into the next day—avoid redosing and plan for extended sedation. Its CNS depressant effects are synergistic with alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, gabapentinoids, first-generation antihistamines, and other sedatives, markedly increasing the risk of respiratory depression and overdose. Because of slow onset (30–60 min) and prolonged peaks (1–4 h), impatience-driven redosing is a common error—wait several hours before judging effect. Driving and safety-sensitive tasks can be impaired for 12–24+ hours; next‑day effects are common at higher doses or with repeated dosing. Tolerance to sedative/anxiolytic effects emerges quickly with regular use; dependence can develop within weeks, so courses should be short and dose minimal. Abrupt cessation after regular use can precipitate severe withdrawal (including seizures); any taper should be gradual and medically supervised. In older adults and in hepatic impairment, accumulation is more likely and sedation/fall risk is higher—use extra caution and lower doses. Do not crush tablets to inject or plug—binders/fillers and poor water solubility create serious vascular risks and unpredictable absorption. Rough oral equivalence is ~25 mg chlordiazepoxide ≈ 10 mg diazepam; interindividual variability means equivalence is only a guide and not a dosing instruction. For people using other depressants (e.g., opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, gabapentinoids), avoid concomitant use; if exposure has occurred, reduce doses drastically, do not use alone, and ensure monitoring.",

Delayed onset (often ≥60 minutes) increases redose temptation; plan a fixed single dose and wait. Strong sedation, psychomotor impairment, anterograde amnesia, and next-day ‘hangover’ are commonly reported—do not drive, cycle, swim, or operate machinery for at least 24 hours after dosing (longer after high doses). Combining with other depressants—especially opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL or tramadol—markedly increases risk of respiratory depression and fatal overdose; avoid these combinations. If physically dependent, do not abruptly stop: benzodiazepine withdrawal can be severe or life-threatening; taper gradually with clinical guidance. Avoid insufflation or injection: poor solubility and binders increase harm with no benefit; if using powder, prepare a measured solution (e.g., in propylene glycol/ethanol) for volumetric dosing to improve accuracy. Consider pregnancy and neonatal risks: benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may cause neonatal withdrawal; seek medical advice. Given frequent counterfeit/overdosed tablets in the market, prefer known-concentration solutions and send suspect samples to a lab drug-checking service when feasible.",

    "notes": "• Urinary pH strongly controls amphetamine clearance: acidic urine shortens the half‑life and alkaline urine can extend it into the 20–30+ hour range; antacids and bicarbonate can therefore increase exposure unpredictably. Avoid intentional pH manipulation for dosing. • Amphetamine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6; potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, ritonavir) can raise blood levels and side‑effects—dose cautiously and avoid stacking with such inhibitors. • Combining with MAOIs is dangerous (hypertensive crisis/serotonin toxicity); observe a minimum 14‑day washout. • Intranasal use damages nasal mucosa over time; to reduce harm, finely powder, use small, spaced lines, alternate nostrils, and rinse with sterile saline afterward. Persistent bleeding/crusting warrants a break. • Stimulant use increases heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature; hot environments, intense exercise, or prolonged dancing further raise hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis risk—take cool breaks, avoid overheating, and sip fluids regularly without overhydrating. • Redosing to chase euphoria rapidly elevates plasma levels due to the long half‑life, worsening anxiety, insomnia, and psychosis risk while providing diminishing returns; set a session cut‑off and prioritize sleep and nutrition. • Antihypertensives may work less effectively during stimulant use; those with cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension should avoid nonmedical use. • Test unknown powders and avoid mixed batches: street “speed” may contain other stimulants or contaminants; use drug‑checking services where available. • Mixing with DXM, tramadol, or triptans increases serotonin‑toxicity risk; know early symptoms (agitation, clonus, hyperthermia) and seek urgent care if they appear. • Sleep deprivation itself can precipitate stimulant psychosis; spacing use by weeks and keeping doses modest lowers this risk.

    "notes": "Reasoning and evidence for harm-reduction additions (with sources):\n- Prodrug to GHB: Aceburic acid is the acetate ester at 4‑OH of GHB, expected to be rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to active GHB. Community chemists have long noted this, explicitly calling it “4‑acetoxy‑GHB… metabolised pretty rapidly by esterases into GHB.” This supports treating dosing, interactions, and risks as GHB‑like.\n- Steep dose–response and tight redose window: GHB has a very steep curve; TripSit warns even small overdoses can progress from euphoria to unrousable sleep/coma. Therefore, space redoses by at least 2 hours and avoid stacking. This is crucial because aceburic’s slightly delayed onset versus GBL increases premature redose risk.\n- Accurate measurement: Liquids/powders should be measured with a precise scale or known‑concentration solution; poor measurement is a leading cause of G‑outs. Drugs‑Forum and Erowid emphasize accurate dosing and variability of liquids; do not swig from containers.\n- Avoid depressant mixing: Alcohol, benzos, opioids, barbiturates markedly increase risk of respiratory depression, vomiting, and aspiration. TripSit lists these combinations as unsafe; SaferParty repeatedly warns of life‑threatening additive CNS/respiratory depression with GHB/GBL plus depressants.\n- Stimulants caution: Uppers can mask sedation, leading to risk‑taking, mis‑timed redosing, and cardiovascular strain. SaferParty highlights this general risk with downer–upper mixes.\n- Overdose management: There is no specific antidote; management is supportive with airway protection. Community HR stresses recovery position to reduce aspiration risk and to monitor breathing until help arrives. Do not give stimulants or more substances. Public‑domain reviews of GHB toxicity also emphasize supportive care and respiratory monitoring.\n- Onset/kinetics framing: Compared with GHB salts, prodrugs like GBL have faster onset; aceburic appears intermediate (slower than GBL, near GHB). TripSit’s GHB timings (10–40 min onset, 1–3 h total) and the clinical review of GHB PK/PD justify conservative timing and spacing recommendations for the ester.\n- Mucosal/GI irritation and pH: Acidic or strongly basic G‑related solutions can burn mucosa. Users and moderators on Bluelight report oral and cheek burns when solutions are not properly neutralized. For aceburic acid, dissolving and buffering to near‑neutral pH with food‑grade carbonate reduces throat irritation and likely discourages corrosive injury.\n- Dependence & withdrawal risk: GHB dependence can develop rapidly with around‑the‑clock use; withdrawal can be severe and requires medical care (often benzodiazepines as first‑line). The clinical review and Drugs‑Forum resources document this. Set hard frequency limits (e.g., max 2–3 uses/week) to minimize risk.\n- Legal risk context: EUDA reports GHB/GBL as depressants of concern; many jurisdictions control GHB and often its prodrugs/precursors. As an ester of a scheduled drug, aceburic may be considered controlled; check local law.\n- Practical HR tips: Use timers (phone/app) to enforce redose spacing; community tools exist for G tracking. Keep a sober sitter, avoid driving for at least 6 hours after last strong dose, and lock up supply to prevent accidental ingestion.\n\nConcise HR guidance:\n- Treat aceburic doses cautiously as GHB‑equivalent after accounting for mass; start low, wait full onset. Use a 0.01 g scale or standardized solution; never drink from stocks. Keep redose spacing ≥2 h. Avoid all depressant mixes. If someone is unrousable, place in recovery position, monitor breathing, call emergency if apnea/bradycardia occur. Buffer acidic solutions to ~pH 7 to lower throat irritation. Frequent/round‑the‑clock use can cause severe dependence; seek medical help to taper. Because legal status is unclear, possession may carry risk.",

    "notes": "DOM has a slow onset and an extremely long duration; this historically led to non-fatal overdoses in the late 1960s when strong tablets were redosed prematurely. Redosing is discouraged, as intensity can increase significantly several hours after ingestion. Cardiovascular stimulation and peripheral vasoconstriction are commonly reported with DOx compounds; avoid combining with other stimulants or vasoconstrictors and avoid strenuous activity or hot environments; stay cool and sip fluids regularly. Lithium has repeatedly been associated with seizures and severe adverse reactions when combined with serotonergic psychedelics (e.g., LSD); by extension treat DOM + lithium as a dangerous combination. Metabolism involves CYP2D6; potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) may increase exposure, and DOM/related DOx can themselves inhibit CYP2D6—be cautious with co-medications that rely on this pathway. Immunoassay urine screens may return class-positive for ‘amphetamines’ with substituted amphetamines; targeted confirmation (e.g., GC/MS) can detect hydroxy-DOM and other metabolites, and detection windows vary—do not rely on specific ‘one week’ claims. Because DOM is potent at low milligram doses, use a 1 mg-accurate scale or volumetric dosing to reduce dosing error; avoid insufflation due to prolonged vasoconstriction and unpredictable intensity. Be prepared for insomnia during and after the experience; plan 24–36 hours of downtime. Where available, use reagent testing and consider lab drug checking; be aware that DOx has been sold on blotter or as other psychedelics—always wait at least 3 hours before making any dosing decisions.",

Redosing: EMCDDA notes 2C‑I can have a slower onset than expected, which has led some users to prematurely redose or add other drugs; wait at least 2 hours after an oral dose before considering any change. Intranasal risks: snorting 2C‑x (including 2C‑I) is frequently reported as extremely painful and more likely to cause nausea, vomiting, and a harsh stimulant edge; many experienced users avoid the route—if used, reduce dose markedly and expect severe nasal irritation. Cardiovascular strain: phenomenology and receptor data (5‑HT2A/2C and potential alpha‑1 adrenergic action) imply vasoconstriction, mild tachycardia and blood‑pressure elevation; those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or migraine susceptibility should avoid use and all users should minimize exertion/overheating. Serotonergic/seizure‑threshold cautions: avoid combinations with MAOIs entirely and with tramadol due to seizure and serotonin‑toxicity risks; SSRIs/SNRIs may blunt effects and complicate response. Lithium is specifically flagged as dangerous with classical serotonergic psychedelics due to seizure risk; do not combine. Set and setting: stimulation can amplify anxiety—use with a trusted sober sitter in a calm environment; avoid crowded, hot venues on first trials. Hydration and temperature: sip water periodically (not excessively) and take cool breaks if active; overheating increases risk with stimulating psychedelics. Dosing discipline: always allergy test with a very small amount (e.g., 1–3 mg oral), then titrate across separate sessions using a 0.001 g scale; never eyeball. Sleep and after‑effects: residual stimulation can impair sleep into the next day; plan recovery time and do not drive or operate machinery for at least 12–24 hours after significant effects resolve. Legal and substitution risk: 2C‑I is Schedule I in the U.S. and controlled in many countries; the market has historically included mislabeling (including NBOMe and DOx) so reagent test each sample.",

    "notes": "DOB is a potent, long-acting psychedelic amphetamine with active doses in the low milligram range; accurate milligram measurement or volumetric dosing is essential to reduce overdose risk. The onset is slow (often 1–3 hours), so redosing too early is a common error—waiting at least 3–4 hours before any redose materially lowers the chance of an overly strong experience. Severe peripheral vasoconstriction is a known toxicity at high doses; a published JAMA case linked DOB ingestion to diffuse arterial spasm requiring vasodilator treatment—seek urgent care if extremities become cold, numb, discolored, or intensely painful. Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, hypertension) is common; those with vascular disease, Raynaud’s, hypertension, or cardiac risk should avoid DOB or take extra caution. Because DOB is sometimes found on blotters or mis-sold as LSD/other psychedelics, drug checking is strongly advised; when identity is uncertain, take a partial dose and wait several hours because some adulterants (including DOx) have much later onsets than LSD. The duration (often 18–30 hours) and residual stimulation can disrupt sleep into the next day; plan set/setting, obligations, and hydration/nutrition accordingly. Avoid combinations with other stimulants or vasoconstrictors (e.g., decongestants) to reduce additive blood pressure/vasospasm risks. Lithium coadministration with classical psychedelics has been repeatedly cautioned against in harm-reduction charts due to seizure risk; this combination should be avoided. MAOI co-use is high risk because DOB is serotonergic and stimulating; hypertensive crises or serotonin toxicity are possible even at typical doses. Alcohol may mask coming-up anxiety but can worsen dehydration and blood pressure; given the long duration, postponing alcohol until well after the peak (or avoiding it) improves safety. Given variance in street samples, start with a light dose even if prior experiences felt manageable; inter-batch potency and individual sensitivity can differ. If severe agitation, chest pain, or signs of limb ischemia occur, do not delay seeking medical care and disclose suspected DOB/‘DOx’ use so clinicians can monitor and manage vasospasm effectively.",

    "notes": "Carfentanil is one of the most potent opioids identified in drug markets, with estimated quantitative potency around 10,000× morphine and ~100× fentanyl; human activity may begin at ~1 µg, but any specific human lethal dose remains unknown and likely varies widely with tolerance, route, and co‑ingestants. Treat any exposure as a medical emergency. Carfentanil has been detected as an adulterant or substitute for other opioids (e.g., heroin) and can appear in mixed drug supplies; users are often unaware of exposure. Overdose is characterized by rapid and profound respiratory depression, bradycardia, and loss of consciousness; naloxone can reverse opioid toxicity, but compared with heroin, fentanyl‑class overdoses may require faster administration, more rapid escalation, and overall higher or repeated doses of naloxone, with prolonged observation due to recurrent depression. Drug checking resources report that fentanyl test strips (FTS) can detect many fentanyl analogs, including carfentanil, but false negatives/positives are possible; pairing with confirmatory testing and careful sampling across a solution increases detection chances. Do not rely on a single negative result to assume safety. Polysubstance use—especially with benzodiazepines, alcohol, barbiturates, or gabapentinoids—markedly increases the risk of fatal respiratory depression and complicates reversal (naloxone does not reverse non‑opioid sedatives). Because of carfentanil’s potency and risk of recurrent toxicity, bystanders should call emergency services immediately, administer naloxone promptly (repeat if no response in 2–3 minutes), and provide rescue breathing until professionals take over. Expect need for multiple naloxone doses in some cases. Carfentanil presence in local markets is highly variable; relying on lab‑based drug checking programs (e.g., GC/MS) provides more definitive identification than immunoassay strips alone. ",

    "notes": "Flutoprazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine; its primary active metabolite is norflurazepam (a.k.a. desalkylflurazepam), which has a long half-life and contributes to prolonged sedation and accumulation. This greatly increases next-day impairment and the risk that redosing will lead to blackouts. Driving or operating machinery can remain unsafe for 24–48+ hours after dosing, particularly with repeated use. Combining flutoprazepam with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, or other depressants markedly raises overdose risk through additive/synergistic respiratory and CNS depression; naloxone will reverse opioid effects but not benzodiazepine sedation, so mixed overdoses may only be partially reversed. Long-acting benzodiazepines commonly appear in drug checking of the unregulated opioid supply (e.g., benzo-dope), which complicates overdose response and recovery; test your supply when possible and assume sedation may outlast the opioid. Tolerance to benzodiazepines can develop within days to weeks of regular use, while reversal of tolerance can take weeks; avoid daily use and space sessions by multiple days to reduce escalation. Abrupt cessation after frequent use can precipitate a dangerous withdrawal (including seizures); if dependent, taper gradually with medical supervision rather than stopping suddenly. Elderly individuals and those with pulmonary disease or sleep apnea are at increased risk of falls, confusion, and respiratory depression with long-acting benzodiazepines. Avoid using stimulants to counter sedation: this does not restore coordination/judgment and increases the likelihood of risky redosing. Because active duration is very long, single-dose trials should be small and well-spaced (e.g., at least 72 hours) before considering any redose. If using powders or liquids of uncertain strength, employ volumetric dosing to improve accuracy; in an unregulated market, consider drug checking services to verify identity and dose.",

    "notes": "Dietary tyramine restriction is essential on phenelzine because irreversible MAO‑A/MAO‑B inhibition allows gut tyramine to trigger massive norepinephrine release; even 10–25 mg dietary tyramine has caused severe headache and hypertensive crisis in susceptible patients. Carry a current MAOI warning card/medical ID and tell every prescriber, dentist, and anesthetist in advance; peri‑operative teams often adjust sympathomimetic doses and avoid serotonergic agents. Do NOT combine with serotonergic drugs or OTC cold/flu products (DXM, chlorpheniramine/brompheniramine, phenylephrine/pseudoephedrine) due to risks of serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. Recognize hypertensive crisis: sudden severe occipital or throbbing headache, neck stiffness, chest pain, palpitations, profuse sweating, pallor/flushing, nausea/vomiting, vision changes, or marked BP elevation—treat as an emergency and explicitly state “on an MAOI” to responders. Recognize serotonin toxicity: agitation/confusion, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia/clonus, tremor, diarrhea, fever, fluctuating BP/HR—seek urgent care and stop serotonergic exposures. Washouts matter because MAO inhibition persists until new enzyme is synthesized: allow at least 14 days after stopping phenelzine before starting other serotonergic/adrenergic agents; allow longer after fluoxetine before starting phenelzine (commonly 5–6 weeks minimum). Limit caffeine—MAOIs can potentiate pressor effects; keep intake consistent and modest and avoid large bolus doses. Alcohol: avoid tyramine‑rich forms (tap/draught beers, some craft/aged beers, red wine); if any alcohol is consumed, choose low‑tyramine spirits in small amounts and never with other contraindicated agents. Orthostatic hypotension is common—rise slowly, hydrate regularly, and discuss salt/fluid strategies or compression garments with a clinician if symptomatic. Hepatotoxicity, although uncommon, is documented: obtain baseline and periodic liver function tests; discontinue and seek evaluation for dark urine, jaundice, pruritus, unexplained fatigue, or right‑upper‑quadrant pain. Hydrazine MAOIs (phenelzine, isocarboxazid) can deplete vitamin B6 via hydrazone formation; clinicians sometimes supplement pyridoxine (B6) rather than pyridoxal forms—discuss with your prescriber. For dental/local anesthesia, inform the provider; epinephrine‑containing solutions and indirect‑acting sympathomimetics may have exaggerated effects; avoid serotonergic peri‑operative drugs (e.g., meperidine, tramadol, large/repeated fentanyl, ondansetron, metoclopramide). Never combine phenelzine with MDMA, 2C‑x/DOx/NBOMe phenethylamines, or tryptamines; reports and HR consensus consider these combinations high‑risk for life‑threatening events. If switching therapies, coordinate with a specialist; faster washouts or cross‑tapers are hazardous with irreversible MAOIs.",

    "notes": "— Pharmacology: In vitro profiling shows 2‑aminoindane acts as a monoamine transporter substrate with higher potency at NET and DAT than at SERT, and it binds α2‑adrenergic receptors at low‑to‑mid‑nanomolar Ki, consistent with reports of peripheral vasoconstriction, piloerection and mild analgesia. This profile distinguishes it from serotonergic aminoindanes such as MDAI. — Dose uncertainty: Formal human dose‑finding data are lacking; community reports vary widely, from inactive at 10–20 mg oral to clear stimulation at 50–100+ mg, with rectal administration increasing intensity. Start low, especially with new batches. — Duration and redosing: The active phase is short, but residual stimulation can prolong into insomnia; repeated redoses compress sleep and may precipitate anxiety or paranoid thoughts. Build a clear ‘no‑redose after X hours’ rule before starting. — Cardiovascular risk: Expect elevations in BP/HR; those with hypertension, arrhythmia, or other cardiovascular disease should avoid. Seek urgent care for chest pain, severe headache, confusion, or temperature >38.5 °C. — ROA risks: Intranasal use is notably painful and damaging to mucosa; use isotonic saline rinses if mistakenly insufflated. Rectal use should employ sterile water, body‑temperature isotonic solution and clean syringes (no needles), and precise volumetric dosing; avoid if there is rectal bleeding or inflammation. — Comedown/sleep: Prefer non‑pharmacologic sleep hygiene first (dark room, magnesium glycinate, hydration). If a sedative is used, avoid alcohol co‑use and do not stack multiple depressants. — Drug checking: Aminoindanes/NPS are frequently mis‑sold; confirm identity with multi‑reagent testing and, ideally, lab analysis (GC/MS/FTIR). Reagent color reactions for 2‑AI are inconsistent across batches; treat color tests as presumptive only. — Tolerance: Acute tolerance rises quickly during a session and decays over about a week; spacing sessions ≥7 days is prudent.",

Because active dosing is in the single‑milligram range for many users, a 0.001 g scale and preferably volumetric dosing are strongly recommended to avoid overshooting. Allow at least 2 hours after an oral dose before considering any redose; creeping effects and long tails make premature redosing a common pitfall. Expect pronounced vasoconstriction in some users (cold extremities, tingling); escalating doses to overcome this can worsen cardiovascular strain without adding desired effects. Sleep debt dramatically increases psychiatric risks (paranoia, anxiety, dysphoria); set a hard cutoff time and plan sleep hygiene. People with hypertension, arrhythmia, or other cardiovascular disease should avoid 4F‑MPH; if chest pain, severe headache, or palpitations occur, stop and seek medical advice. Avoid combining with MDMA or other stimulants due to additive heart‑rate/BP and overheating risks; if on antidepressants, avoid poly‑serotonergic stacks and monitor for agitation, tremor, sweating, or clonus. Harm‑reduction essentials: reagent/lab test where available; keep hydration modest and electrolytes balanced; avoid alcohol; do not drive; and do not eyeball doses.",

    "notes": "Hydromorphone is ~5–7× as potent as morphine; small dosing errors—especially by IV or in non‑tolerant users—can cause fatal respiratory depression. Co‑use with other CNS depressants (benzodiazepines, alcohol, GHB/GBL, Z‑drugs) markedly increases overdose risk due to additive/synergistic respiratory depression; avoid these combinations and keep naloxone on hand. Intranasal bioavailability clusters around ~50–60%, while oral figures vary widely (~30–60% across sources), so insufflated doses should usually be lower than oral for comparable effect. Extended‑release (ER/CR) tablets contain tamper‑resistant polymers; crushing/heating/injecting them can cause gelled clots, pulmonary emboli, and dose dumping—do not inject ER/CR products. If people inject diverted tablets despite risks, use sterile water, new equipment every time, and a 0.22 µm micron filter to remove insoluble binders; never share or reuse syringes to reduce BBV risks (HIV/HCV). In unregulated markets, counterfeit ‘Dilaudid’/opioid tablets may contain fentanyl, nitazenes, benzos, or xylazine; consider drug checking and treat unknown pills as very potent—start with a tiny ‘allergy’ dose and use fentanyl test strips when available. Renal impairment increases risk of accumulation of hydromorphone metabolites (e.g., H3G) that are associated with neuroexcitatory effects; reduce exposure and seek medical advice if kidney function is reduced. Compared with morphine, hydromorphone tends to cause less histamine‑mediated pruritus, but constipation, nausea, and drowsiness are common; hydrate and consider a bowel regimen if used repeatedly. After a period of abstinence (e.g., detox, jail, illness), tolerance drops quickly and ‘usual’ doses can become lethal—restart at a fraction of prior dose. Carry naloxone and train peers: give 1–4 mg IN or 0.4–2 mg IM/IV, repeat every 2–3 minutes if no response, provide rescue breathing and place in recovery position while waiting for EMS; multiple doses may be needed with potent adulterants. Avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least several hours after dosing; residual impairment may outlast euphoria. Rotating between opioids requires caution due to incomplete cross‑tolerance; when changing substances or routes, reduce expected equivalent doses and titrate slowly.",

    "notes": "Dimenhydrinate is a salt that dissociates into diphenhydramine (anticholinergic H1 antihistamine) and 8‑chlorotheophylline (a methylxanthine with adenosine receptor blockade), which can both shape effects and side‑effects. At high doses, users can develop a full anticholinergic toxidrome: agitation, confusion, hallucinations, mydriasis, dry skin/mucosa, urinary retention, hyperthermia, tachycardia, decreased bowel sounds. Onset and peak can be slow (up to ~2–3 hours); redosing early risks stacking and unexpectedly severe delirium. Avoid heat, strenuous activity, or hot environments while intoxicated due to impaired sweating and hyperthermia risk. Do not drive or operate machinery for the rest of the day and potentially the next morning because impairing sedation and vestibular effects may persist beyond the perceived ‘trip.’ People with glaucoma, urinary retention/BPH, or significant pulmonary disease should avoid use without medical supervision due to anticholinergic effects exacerbating these conditions. Children and older adults are more susceptible to delirium, paradoxical excitation, seizures, and serious toxicity; keep products locked away and never use recreationally in these groups. Dimenhydrinate has been associated with QTc prolongation and conduction disturbances at high exposure (largely via diphenhydramine), so avoid combining with other QT‑prolonging drugs and seek care if syncope or palpitations occur. Seizures are a recognized complication of antihistamine toxicity; avoid co‑ingesting agents that lower seizure threshold and seek urgent care if tremor, clonus, or seizure activity appears. If signs of anticholinergic toxicity emerge (confusion, inability to sweat, very hot skin, urinary retention, visual disturbances), seek emergency help; in hospital, benzodiazepines and temperature control are first‑line, and physostigmine may be considered by clinicians for severe pure anticholinergic delirium. Verify the active ingredient on any ‘motion‑sickness’ or ‘original/less drowsy’ products; similarly named brand variants in different markets may contain different actives. Because each 100 mg of dimenhydrinate contains only about 53–55.5 mg of diphenhydramine base, very large ‘recreational’ dimenhydrinate doses can covertly correspond to high diphenhydramine exposure and its cardiotoxic/deliriant risks.",

    "notes": "- Dextroamphetamine is metabolized by CYP2D6; strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, quinidine) can increase plasma levels and side‑effects; start low and avoid stacking with multiple inhibitors. Evidence: DrugBank metabolism section; StatPearls warns that co‑use with CYP2D6 inhibitors elevates serotonin‑toxicity risk.\n- Co‑administration with MAOIs is contraindicated and requires a minimum 14‑day washout to avoid hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. This applies to classical MAOIs and agents with MAOI activity (linezolid, methylene blue).\n- Serotonergic combinations (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, tramadol, dextromethorphan, triptans) increase serotonin‑toxicity risk; seek medical care for agitation, tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, hyperthermia.\n- Urinary and GI pH strongly influence exposure: alkaline urine slows elimination and increases half‑life; acidic urine accelerates clearance. Acidic fruit juices can also reduce GI absorption; conversely, antacids/alkalinizers may increase exposure. Plan dosing and timing accordingly and avoid deliberate alkalinization to “potentiate.”\n- Cardiovascular risks rise with dose, redosing, dehydration, and co‑stimulants (e.g., caffeine, decongestants). Screen for personal/family cardiac disease and stop use if chest pain, syncope, or sustained tachycardia occur.\n- Heat stress and overexertion can precipitate hyperthermia; avoid heavy exercise and hot environments during peak effects; maintain moderate hydration with electrolytes, but do not over‑hydrate.\n- Compulsive redosing is a recognized pattern with stimulants; pre‑measure doses, keep reserves out of reach, and plan a hard stop time to reduce binge risk.\n- Expect common acute effects like appetite suppression, insomnia, anxiety/irritability, bruxism, dry mouth, tachycardia, and increased BP; jaw protection (sugar‑free gum) and oral hygiene help mitigate bruxism/dry mouth.\n- High or repeated doses raise risks of paranoid ideation and psychosis; sleep, nutrition, and multi‑day breaks markedly reduce this risk. Seek medical attention for persistent hallucinations, severe agitation, or suicidality.\n- Difficulty urinating and peripheral vasoconstriction (cold fingers/toes) can occur; take bathroom breaks and keep warm; seek care if painful retention or severe pallor/paresthesia occurs.\n- Extended‑release capsules/patches are designed for slow delivery; tampering (crushing, chewing, extracting) defeats the mechanism and may cause overdose. Treat transdermal patch disposal carefully to prevent diversion. (General HR; product forms listed on DrugBank.)\n- Nutrition: plan balanced meals around use days and refeed on comedown; stimulants can suppress appetite and, over time, contribute to weight loss and low immunity.

Human pharmacokinetics are not established; user timelines suggest a 4–8 h primary effect window with residual stimulation and insomnia into the next day. Marked batch-to-batch potency variability has been reported; always allergy test (1–2 mg), use a milligram scale, and titrate slowly. Redosing can escalate cardiovascular strain and insomnia; set a hard cap and avoid extended binges (>24 h) due to psychosis/seizure risk. Stimulant risks include hypertension, tachycardia, vasoconstriction (cold extremities), hyperthermia, and dehydration; actively manage temperature and electrolytes, especially during dancing/exertion. Avoid combinations that raise serotonin (e.g., DXM, tramadol, MDMA) or lower seizure threshold (e.g., bupropion); MAOIs are a hard contraindication. Use drug checking: vendors sometimes mislabel ring-substituted amphetamines/cathinones; multi-reagent testing and, where available, spectrometric checking reduce adulterant risks. Nasal use increases local tissue irritation and infection risk; use clean equipment and isotonic saline rinses post-session. People with cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or a history of psychosis should avoid use; anyone on prescription psych meds should consider interaction risks and spacing. Space sessions by at least 1–2 weeks to allow tolerance and sleep patterns to normalize; prioritize nutrition (carbohydrates, protein) and rehydration after use.

PMA is frequently mis-sold as MDMA in pressed pills or powders, but it has slower onset (often >60 minutes) and less euphoria, prompting risky redosing that has been implicated in clusters of fatalities. Expect marked hyperthermia and hypertension risk; avoid hot environments, prolonged dancing, and strenuous activity. If effects are unexpectedly delayed or atypical for MDMA, do not redose and seek a cool, quiet space. Hydrate with small sips of isotonic fluids (~300 mL/hour) and avoid overhydration. Reagent testing: PMA typically shows no reaction with Marquis/Mecke; PMMA may show a blue Simon’s reaction without MDMA-like Marquis/Mecke changes. Absence of the expected MDMA reaction is a red flag—only lab drug checking (e.g., GC/MS) can confirm composition. Strongly avoid combinations with serotonergic agents (SSRIs, MAOIs, tramadol, dextromethorphan, triptans) and with other stimulants or MDMA, due to serotonin syndrome and hyperthermia risk. Seek emergency help for high temperature, confusion/agitation, severe headache, chest pain, or persistent vomiting. Given its poor safety profile and repeated association with deaths, routine recreational use is not advised.",

Equipment or cutting errors have caused blackouts and unintentional overdoses; volumetric dosing and a calibrated scale (0.001 g readability) are harm‑reduction best practices.\n• Strong amnesia/blackout risk: many reports describe anterograde amnesia with disinhibition. Avoid redosing during the first 2 hours; set timers and keep a written log of each dose to reduce binge/blackout risk.\n• Combining with depressants greatly increases overdose risk via additive respiratory/CNS depression. The highest‑risk mixes are with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, gabapentinoids, and dissociatives.\n• Counterfeit/unknown tablets are common: many “benzo” pills contain unexpected substances (other potent benzos, antihistamines, or even opioids). Whenever possible, use a trusted drug‑checking service; assume mislabeling risk in unregulated markets.\n• Next‑day impairment is possible even at low doses; do not drive or operate machinery until fully sober. Residual effects may last into the next day.\n• Dependence and withdrawal: benzodiazepine withdrawal can be severe and potentially life‑threatening (seizures). Do not stop abruptly after repeated use; medical supervision and gradual tapering are advised.\n• Avoid injecting or snorting: most benzos and tablet fillers have poor aqueous solubility; crushing tablets for solutions risks vein damage and emboli.\n• Overdose management: flumazenil is a hospital‑use antidote; unsupervised use can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent polydrug users—seek emergency care instead of attempting layperson reversal.\n• High variability across batches/vendors has been noted for designer benzos; treat each new batch cautiously and test a low dose first (“allergy test”), waiting full onset.\n• Keep access to additional doses limited (pre‑measured only), secure sharp objects/valuables, and avoid online shopping or driving while under the influence to mitigate blackout‑related harms.

    "notes": "Reasoned additions and changes (with sources):\n- Limited formal data: There is no robust, peer‑reviewed human pharmacokinetic or clinical safety literature specific to 4‑FEA as of November 6, 2025; most knowledge comes from user reports and by-analogy with 4‑FA. Therefore, conservative dosing, single‑substance trials, and avoidance of polydrug combinations are prudent. (General inference; see 4‑FA summaries and community reports.)\n- Cardiovascular/neurological risks by analogy with 4‑FA: 4‑FA’s popularity in the Netherlands was followed by warnings and policy action citing strokes, brain haemorrhage, severe headaches, and cardiac issues. Given structural and effect overlap, 4‑FEA users should treat severe headache, chest pain, or neurological deficits as medical emergencies. (Analogy from 4‑FA alerts.)\n- Hydration/temperature: As with MDMA-like entactogens, overheating and dehydration are key hazards at parties; use MDMA harm‑reduction hydration guidance (roughly 250 ml/h resting and up to 500 ml/h dancing, plus cooling breaks) as a cautious proxy, while avoiding overhydration. (Proxy guidance from MDMA HR.)\n- Serotonergic interactions: Combining serotonergic agents (e.g., MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM) increases serotonin syndrome and/or seizure risk; this is well‑documented for MDMA and tramadol and generalizes to serotonergic amphetamines. (Use MDMA/tramadol interaction documentation as a conservative template.)\n- Redosing/spacing: Strongly limit redosing; leave weeks to months between sessions to allow monoamine recovery (MDMA best‑practice suggests 1–3 months). Users report that 4‑FEA can feel sedating or confusing at higher doses rather than more euphoric. (Proxy spacing rule from MDMA HR; user reports for sedation/confusion.)\n- Route of administration: Oral is generally preferred. Users frequently report that insufflation increases peripheral side‑effects with less empathogenic payoff; some moderators caution that vaporizing halogenated amphetamines is questionable. (Community harm‑reduction.)\n- Individual variability: Reports range from MDMA‑like euphoria at 120–200 mg oral to dysphoria/sedation even at higher doses; this variability underscores the need for allergy testing (e.g., 1–2 mg) and very slow titration. (Community reports.)\n- Urinary retention and jaw clenching are commonly mentioned; magnesium may subjectively help bruxism for some with MDMA, but evidence is limited—avoid excessive supplementation and prioritize rest and hydration. (User reports and general HR; avoid high-dose supplements.)\nAugmented guidance incorporated accordingly below.",

    "notes": "• Tramadol lowers seizure threshold; risk rises with higher single doses (>250–300 mg), rapid redosing, co-use of stimulants or other seizure‑threshold–lowering medicines (e.g., bupropion, many antidepressants), history of seizures, or electrolyte abnormalities. Seizures have occurred even within the therapeutic range in susceptible people. • Time-to-peak is slow (3–4 h). Redosing early to “chase” effects substantially increases overdose and seizure risk; wait through the peak before deciding about any redose. • Tramadol is a μ‑opioid agonist and a serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; combining with serotonergic agents (SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs/triptans/MDMA/DXM/MAOIs) can precipitate serotonin syndrome (agitation, sweating, tremor/clonus, hyperreflexia, hyperthermia). Seek urgent care if symptoms appear. • Genetic differences matter: CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers produce more M1 (O‑desmethyltramadol) and face greater risk of opioid toxicity/respiratory depression at standard doses; poor metabolizers may get weaker analgesia but relatively more SNRI‑type adverse effects. • CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, quinidine) raise parent‑drug levels and lower M1, shifting effects toward SNRI toxicity and seizures; monitor closely or avoid. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers can also alter exposure; carbamazepine induction can blunt effects and is not recommended with tramadol due to seizure concerns. • Avoid combining with CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines/Z‑drugs, GHB) and/or other opioids—these combinations are strongly associated with fatal respiratory depression and require naloxone availability if use occurs. • Do not inject or snort tablets/capsules: non‑sterile excipients can cause abscesses, vascular injury, and emboli; bypassing first‑pass metabolism unpredictably alters the tramadol:M1 ratio and does not reliably enhance effects. • Taper after sustained daily use to reduce withdrawal; discontinuation may include both opioid (GI upset, aches, insomnia) and SNRI‑like symptoms (irritability, anxiety, electric‑shock sensations). • Max typical IR adult total daily dose is 400 mg; many adverse events and seizures are reported above this. Extended‑release products have different limits—follow product‑specific guidance. • Not recommended in children <12 years; contraindicated for post‑tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy analgesia in <18 years. Breastfeeding is discouraged due to risk of high M1 exposure in infants of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers. • Avoid driving or hazardous tasks until you’ve tested individual response on a separate day; sedation and delayed peak can impair performance hours after dosing. • Heat, dehydration, and long dance/party settings increase risks from serotonergic toxicity; hydrate, cool, and seek help early if overheating or confusion occurs.",

Do not crush or chew prolonged‑release morphine (dose dumping) and never inject tamper‑resistant or oral formulations; insoluble excipients raise the risk of emboli and infections. If injecting occurs despite risks, strict harm‑reduction includes single‑use sterile syringes and sterile water, skin prep with alcohol, and micron/wheel filtration to remove particulates. Start low and go slow, with ample time before redosing (at least one full peak window), particularly for opioid‑naïve users or when mixing with other sedating medicines. Avoid driving or operating machinery for many hours after dosing; residual psychomotor impairment can outlast peak analgesia. Expect constipation (tolerance develops poorly); hydration, fiber, and proactive bowel regimens reduce risk. Pruritus and hypotension are more likely with rapid IV bolus due to non‑IgE histamine release; slower titration mitigates this. For non‑medical products/powders, variability and adulteration (e.g., unexpected potency or other actives) are common—use drug‑checking where available, test a small amount first, and avoid mixing with other depressants. Opioid‑induced hyperalgesia can occur with chronic or high‑dose exposure; increasing dose may worsen pain—consider reassessment and tapering strategies if analgesia paradoxically declines.",

User reports and The Drug Users Bible indicate very fast onset and meaningful effects from single-digit milligram doses. Batch-to-batch variability is common in the NPS market.\n- Vaporizing and insufflation produce rapid spikes that strongly reinforce compulsive redosing (“fiending”), increasing cardiovascular strain, sleep loss, and psychosis risk; many users describe vaping as particularly moreish. Avoid marathon sessions; plan hard stops and sleep recovery.\n- Intranasal use is described as caustic/irritating; some users report significant nasal damage and bleeding lasting days. Consider oral routes to reduce local harm, though systemic risks remain. Rinse nasal passages with saline post-use if insufflating.\n- Psychosis, paranoia, and severe anxiety are commonly reported during binges or after prolonged sleep deprivation. Strictly limit session length, ensure sleep, and avoid redosing when anxiety or tachycardia rise.\n- Cardiovascular risks include tachycardia, hypertension, chest pain, and vasoconstriction; avoid if you have heart disease, arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, or are on interacting meds. Seek medical care for persistent chest pain, severe headache, or confusion.\n- Maintain hydration and electrolytes; avoid overheating. Stimulants can suppress appetite—plan nutrition, limit caffeine.\n- Avoid combining with MAOIs or other potent stimulants due to hypertensive and hyperadrenergic crises. Be cautious with tramadol or bupropion (lowered seizure threshold) and with serotonergic meds (agitation/overstimulation).\n- Reagent test and, where possible, use lab drug-checking; cathinone markets are adulterated and mislabeling among pyrovalerone analogues is common.\n- Tolerance builds quickly during repeated use and fades over days to weeks; frequent redosing escalates total intake rapidly. Space sessions by at least 1–2 weeks to reduce compulsive patterns.\n- Using benzodiazepines or alcohol to ‘come down’ can mask warning signs and add respiratory risk if combined; if used, keep doses minimal, avoid alcohol/opioids, and prioritize sleep hygiene.\n- Avoid IV use; it greatly increases acute harms and addiction liability and is not supported by harm-reduction communities for this class.",

    "notes": "• Dosage and timing: Community-sourced reference doses for IPPH converge around oral 5–20 mg common and insufflated 5–20 mg common; start low and allow full onset before redosing to avoid inadvertent stacking. This is based on reference figures compiled in Drug Users Bible and corroborating forum reports.\n• ROA-specific onset: Intranasal onset is typically faster (≈5–15 min) and duration shorter than oral; this mirrors methylphenidate’s ROA differences and is echoed in user reports for IPPH. Avoid interpreting a slow oral come-up as a cue to redose early.\n• Nasal harm: Multiple user reports describe significant intranasal discomfort with phenidates, including IPPH; repeated snorting can irritate/damage mucosa. Prefer oral use, space sessions widely, and if snorted, perform gentle saline rinses hours later (not immediately). Avoid adding baking soda or ad hoc buffers—these can worsen irritation or alter absorption unpredictably.\n• Cardiovascular risk: As an NDRI stimulant, IPPH can raise heart rate and blood pressure; those with hypertension, arrhythmias, or cardiovascular disease should avoid. If severe headache, chest pain, or BP approaches emergency ranges, seek help promptly.\n• Caffeine synergy: Even small IPPH doses combined with high caffeine loads can produce tremor, jitteriness, and eye twitching; moderate caffeine and avoid energy drinks on IPPH days.\n• Alcohol: Co-use increases overall strain and can impair judgment; unlike methylphenidate, IPPH was developed in part to reduce certain interaction liabilities, but human data are limited. Prefer to avoid alcohol on IPPH.\n• Seizure threshold: Combining stimulants with bupropion or tramadol may lower seizure threshold; keep doses conservative, avoid sleep deprivation, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., after heavy sweating), and do not mix with MAOIs.\n• Compulsive redosing: Users describe milder euphoria than methylphenidate but still report redosing loops; pre-measure and limit access to discourage binges.\n• Sleep: Insomnia can occur, especially with late-day dosing; set a personal cutoff several hours before bedtime and prioritize recovery sleep after use days.\n• Drug checking: IPPH has appeared in checking program submissions; verify identity where services exist, and be aware that mislabeled stimulants circulate.\n• Legal note (UK): Phenidates including IPPH were targeted in UK controls in 2015; possession/supply laws evolved—always check your current local law before purchase or possession.

    "notes": "Identification and naming: Nitrazepam is a long-acting nitrobenzodiazepine; common brand name is Mogadon and synonyms include RO 5-3059 and RO 4-5360—use correct naming to avoid confusing it with flunitrazepam or other benzos. Residual impairment: Because the elimination half-life averages 26 hours (range ~15–38 h), next‑day psychomotor impairment and a 'hangover' effect are common, even if you feel subjectively sober. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided until fully recovered. Interindividual variability: Oral bioavailability spans ~53–94%, so two people given the same dose can have very different effects; titrate slowly and avoid stacking doses. Combination risks: Co‑use with opioids, alcohol, barbiturates or GHB/GBL markedly increases the risk of respiratory depression, loss of consciousness and fatal overdose; if any depressants are involved, do not use alone and have naloxone available when opioids are present. General CNS depressant stacking (e.g., Z‑drugs, sedating antihistamines, gabapentinoids) also increases blackout and breathing suppression risk—avoid or use only with strong safeguards. Caffeine and stimulants may mask sedation without restoring coordination or reaction time; DrugBank advises limiting caffeine and strictly avoiding alcohol while on nitrazepam. Tolerance/withdrawal: Regular use can produce tolerance within weeks and dependence; abrupt discontinuation can cause severe withdrawal including seizures—medical tapering is essential. Populations: Older adults and those with liver impairment are more prone to prolonged sedation, confusion, and falls—use lower doses with extra monitoring. Legality/access: Nitrazepam is not marketed in the United States (reducing legitimate supply there); in unregulated markets, counterfeit 'benzos' may contain more potent analogues—drug checking and conservative dosing are strongly advised. Therapeutic note: Beyond hypnotic use, nitrazepam has anticonvulsant properties (e.g., myoclonic seizures), but non-medical redosing to chase sedation can rapidly escalate risk due to delayed peaks and long half-life.",

    "notes": "Nimetazepam is marketed mainly in parts of Asia (e.g., as 5 mg 'Erimin 5'); non-medical availability often involves counterfeit tablets that may contain other benzodiazepines, making potency unpredictable—assume unknown composition and avoid mixed-source pills unless lab-checked. Next‑day sedation, impaired coordination, and memory gaps are common with long/medium-acting benzodiazepines; avoid driving or operating machinery until at least the day after use and longer if residual effects are present. Combining benzodiazepines with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, or other depressants greatly increases the risk of life‑threatening respiratory depression and fatal overdose; avoid co‑use and never use alone. Tolerance develops quickly with repeated use and can encourage escalation; spacing uses by weeks and avoiding consecutive‑night dosing reduces risk of rapid tolerance. Abrupt cessation after sustained use can cause severe withdrawal (anxiety, insomnia, agitation, tremor, seizures); any taper should be slow and medically supervised. 'Blackout' amnesia can lead to unintentional redosing—pre‑measure a single dose, keep a log, and have a trusted sober person hold the supply if needed. Crushing or injecting tablets is dangerous due to insoluble binders/fillers (risk of vein damage, infection) and unpredictable kinetics; stick to oral use only. People who are pregnant can produce neonates with benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms; discuss any exposure with a clinician. Older adults and those with renal or general frailty have heightened sensitivity to sedation and falls; lower thresholds and longer spacing are prudent. Reports note nimetazepam may partially metabolise to nitrazepam and has high oral bioavailability with relatively rapid onset—this can increase misuse potential; extra caution with redosing is warranted. In unregulated markets, prioritize drug checking where available; if not, avoid brand‑dependent assumptions (e.g., 'Erimin 5' logo) as authenticity is unreliable.",

    "notes": "Harm‑reduction justifications and key cautions: 1) Steep dose–response: the gap between desired effects and unrousable sleep/coma is small; small misestimations or redoses can cause loss of consciousness and respiratory depression. Therefore, start low, measure precisely, and avoid redosing for at least 2 hours; set a timer to prevent ‘stacking’. Community and agency guides consistently emphasise this risk. 2) Liquids vary in strength: illicit GHB/GBL solutions differ widely and sellers often cannot state concentration. Dose by mass where possible; if using liquid, use a 1–3 ml oral syringe to 0.1 ml, never caps or swigs. Always label and keep your dose with you to avoid accidental ingestion by others. 3) Prodrugs differ: GBL and 1,4‑BD convert to GHB but generally have faster onset and, for GBL, more potency by volume; never substitute ml‑for‑ml with GHB. Always dilute GBL; it is an industrial solvent and can irritate mucosa. 4) Absolutely avoid mixing with other depressants (alcohol, benzos, opioids, Z‑drugs, sedating antihistamines): combinations greatly increase risk of vomiting, aspiration, respiratory arrest, coma, and death. 5) Redose discipline: despite a short plasma half‑life, functional effects and risk persist several hours; impulsive redosing to chase euphoria or to force sleep is a common pathway to overdose and dependence. 6) Chemsex context and consent: GHB/GBL can cause amnesia and incapacitation; use only with trusted people, avoid unlabeled communal drinks, and plan for explicit consent. 7) Overdose first aid: if someone becomes unresponsive, place in the recovery position, keep airway clear, monitor breathing, and call emergency services; do not give caffeine or stimulants or additional substances. Vomit aspiration is a key danger while unconscious. 8) Tolerance/dependence: use on consecutive days or frequent ‘around‑the‑clock’ dosing can produce rapid tolerance and severe, potentially life‑threatening withdrawal; limit use to no more than 2–3 days per week and avoid overnight patterns of dosing unless prescribed/clinically supervised. 9) Food and timing: taking on a full stomach can blunt/delay onset; alcohol is metabolised before GHB, so co‑use can lead to accumulation and delayed overdose. 10) Driving and machinery: impairment can persist beyond subjective effects; avoid for the rest of the day after use.",

    "notes": "- Combining temazepam with alcohol, opioids, or GHB/GBL greatly increases the risk of unpredictable deep sedation, respiratory depression, aspiration, and fatal overdose; multiple harm‑reduction teams flag benzodiazepine + depressant combos as particularly high risk. Keep clear separation and avoid co‑use; if opioids are involved, ensure naloxone availability and avoid using alone.\n- Avoid injecting or snorting. Former gel‑filled capsules (“jellies”) led to injection attempts; reports note this formulation was withdrawn in many places due to harms. Temazepam is very poorly water‑soluble (~0.164 mg/mL), so solutions are prone to precipitation and excipient emboli, raising risks of vascular injury, abscess, and tissue necrosis. Oral use is the safer route.\n- Expect amnesia and blackouts at higher doses or with redosing. To reduce harm: pre‑measure a single dose; secure the remainder; avoid online purchases/activities, driving, cooking, or important decisions while under the influence. Next‑day impairment is common; do not drive or operate machinery until fully alert.\n- Tolerance builds quickly with nightly use (often within 2–4 weeks). Dependence and medically significant withdrawal (including seizures) can occur; any long‑term user should taper gradually under medical supervision rather than stopping abruptly.\n- People with respiratory disease, sleep apnoea, or when combined with other sedatives are at higher risk of hypoventilation/airway obstruction; the primary serious risk with benzodiazepines is respiratory depression in vulnerable contexts or polydrug use. Use the lowest effective dose, avoid co‑depressants, and do not use alone.\n- In pregnancy and breastfeeding, prescribed benzodiazepines may be used only when clinically justified; misuse/polydrug use increases risks (e.g., infant sedation/apnoea). Discuss with a clinician; avoid non‑medical use.\n- Drug testing: urine immunoassays typically detect temazepam for ~1–2 days (longer after injecting); hair tests may reflect longer‑term use. Be aware that various benzos and metabolites can cross‑react.\n- Street names for temazepam include “duck eggs” and “jellies”; be wary of non‑pharmaceutical sources due to mislabeling and unknown potency. Prefer known pharmaceutical tablets/capsules if prescribed. ",

Pharmacokinetic notes indicate rapid absorption and rapid plasma clearance with drug not detectable ~4 hours post-dose, yet central stimulation can outlast plasma presence, so timing and avoiding redosing are critical. Historical products (Meratran) contained 1 mg tablets, underscoring high potency and the need for milligram-accurate measurement or volumetric dosing. Overdose/overuse has been associated with anxiety, insomnia, abdominal discomfort, and in severe cases convulsions; individuals with psychosis, schizophrenia, or significant anxiety disorders should avoid due to exacerbation risk. Combining with MAOIs is dangerous with stimulant-class agents; mixing with other stimulants increases cardiovascular and neurotoxic stress and strongly elevates insomnia/psychosis risk. Tramadol and bupropion both lower the seizure threshold and have adverse interaction reports with stimulants; avoid. Because pipradrol-family powders have been mis-sold or confused with far longer-acting analogues (e.g., 2‑DPMP), confirm identity via reagent plus laboratory drug-checking when possible (GC/MS or FTIR); do not assume vendor labels are accurate. Insufflation provides no safety advantage, increases local harm, and may promote compulsive redosing; oral administration allows more controlled onset. Dose early in the day, maintain hydration and nutrition, and schedule a buffer for sleep; do not stack sedatives to ‘force’ sleep, as this can create risky polydrug situations.",

Re‑dosing during the same day (or within 24 h) significantly increases chances of severe agitation, paranoia, and insomnia lasting 1–3 days, with numerous reports of psychosis after multi‑day wakefulness. Intranasal use is commonly reported as caustic to nasal mucosa and provides no safety benefit over oral dosing. Because of the long half‑life, avoid evening dosing; plan for sleep disruption and do not ‘stack’ doses if effects feel light in the first 2 hours. People with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, or significant anxiety/psychotic disorders should avoid 2‑DPMP due to elevated risks (tachycardia, hypertension, panic, psychosis). If severe symptoms appear (chest pain, confusion, hyperthermia, seizures, or unmanageable agitation), seek urgent medical care; supportive cooling, hydration, and clinical benzodiazepines are typical first‑line approaches for stimulant toxicity—do not rely on alcohol or self‑sedation. Mislabeling/substitution has historically been an issue (e.g., ‘Ivory Wave’ products); use professional drug checking where available and wait at least 2 hours after an initial test dose before any consideration of re‑dose. Repeated day‑to‑day use rapidly increases adverse mental effects and yields diminishing functional benefits; spacing uses by multiple weeks lowers harm. Avoid driving or high‑risk tasks with sleep loss or residual stimulation present.",

    "notes": "Gabapentin’s absorption relies on a saturable transporter (LAT1), so the fraction absorbed falls as single‑dose size increases; very large single doses provide diminishing returns but more side‑effects like ataxia and confusion. Evidence indicates T_max ~2–3 h and elimination half‑life ~5–7 h with renal excretion of unchanged drug, so people with impaired kidney function can accumulate the drug; lower doses and longer spacing are safer in renal impairment. Food has minimal clinically significant effect on absorption for immediate‑release gabapentin; however, co‑administration with potent CNS depressants (especially opioids) materially raises risks of oversedation, hypoventilation, and death. Community and clinical harm‑reduction reports document misuse in some settings, particularly in combination with opioids to potentiate effects; this pattern is over‑represented in high‑risk groups (e.g., opioid‑dependent or incarcerated people). Chronic daily use can lead to tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome on abrupt cessation (e.g., anxiety, agitation, insomnia); slow tapers reduce this risk. Cimetidine can reduce gabapentin renal clearance by ~12%; although modest, combine cautiously with other sedatives or in renal impairment. Intranasal use is reported anecdotally but is inefficient and increases local harm; oral use is the least risky route. Do not mix with alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z‑drugs, or opioids; if opioids are used medically, avoid co‑timing and keep doses low with supervision. Avoid driving or hazardous tasks during peak and until you know your personal sensitivity; next‑day sedation and impaired coordination are common at higher doses, especially with other depressants. Misjudging redose timing is common due to delayed onset at higher doses; wait at least 2–3 hours before considering any redose, and avoid stacking with other depressants altogether. These points are drawn from pharmacology texts (DrugBank/NCBI) and harm‑reduction orgs (DrugWise) plus corroborating community reports.",

Residual psychomotor impairment can persist 9–11+ hours; avoid driving or hazardous tasks the next morning and allow a full 8+ hours time in bed. Bitter/metallic taste (dysgeusia) and dry mouth are common and may persist into the next day. Co‑use with other depressants (alcohol, opioids, gabapentinoids, sedating antipsychotics/antihistamines) markedly increases risk of respiratory depression, blackouts, falls, and crashes; avoid such combinations. Hepatic impairment prolongs half‑life and increases next‑day effects; lower doses and extra caution are indicated. Redosing during the same night increases amnesia and disinhibition; due to memory gaps, some users unintentionally redose—pre‑plan a single dose and secure the remainder. If dependence has developed, avoid abrupt cessation; a supervised, gradual taper is safer due to seizure risk. Do not confuse racemic zopiclone dosing (commonly 7.5 mg) with eszopiclone (Lunesta; 1–3 mg)—they are related but not dose‑equivalent.",

    "notes": "Reasoning for additions and changes precedes this JSON. See below.\n\n1) Dose and duration verification: Multiple harm-reduction sources converge on an oral onset around 20–45 minutes and a 4–8 hour main effect window; users often report 300 mg as a common recreational dose, with tolerance driving some to escalate. These ranges justify keeping the listed oral ranges but adding a caution about variability and rapid tolerance. Source: Erowid Methaqualone Basics and Vault.\n2) Depressant combinations: Combining methaqualone with alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioids, or GHB/GBL is high-risk due to additive/synergistic CNS and respiratory depression; aspiration risk rises if unconscious. TripSit’s combination guidance and DrugWise’s interaction notes support class-based cautions; therefore these are placed under 'dangerous' and 'unsafe', with first-generation antihistamines under 'caution'. Sources: TripSit Drug Combinations; DrugWise Alcohol/Drug interactions pages.\n3) Tolerance & overdose risk: Erowid notes that tolerance develops quickly and that tolerance to euphoric effects rises faster than to respiratory depression, increasing overdose risk as people escalate doses. This justifies explicit tolerance guidance and conservative redose advice. Source: Erowid Methaqualone Basics.\n4) Dependence & withdrawal: Methaqualone’s sedative-hypnotic profile and historical clinical experience resemble barbiturates in dependence potential; barbiturate-class withdrawal can be severe and occasionally life-threatening (seizures, delirium), warranting medical supervision for cessation after heavy/prolonged use. This supports strengthening the dependence warning. Source: DrugWise Barbiturates (clinical HR context for sedative-hypnotic withdrawal).\n5) Pharmacokinetics and interactions: DrugBank lists methaqualone as a CYP3A/CYP3A4 substrate. While quantitative PK is sparse publicly, this supports a pragmatic caution that strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., certain azoles/macrolides/cimetidine) may raise levels and inducers (e.g., rifampin/carbamazepine) may lower them. We therefore add a general CYP3A4 caution under 'caution' interactions and mark half-life as uncertain/variable. Source: DrugBank DB04833.\n6) Legality & supply quality: Methaqualone is widely controlled (e.g., US Schedule I; UK Class B). Illicit supply is common and identity may be unreliable; users should treat unknown 'quaalude' tablets/powders as suspect and use lab-based drug checking where available. Sources: Isomerdesign scheduling index; Saferparty Zürich and Toronto’s Drug Checking Service (availability of lab drug checking).\n7) Practical HR: Because onset can be delayed toward an hour (or longer with food), impatient redosing increases overdose risk. Keep first sessions at the low end of 'light', avoid alcohol/other depressants entirely, and do not drive/operate machinery during the experience or the following morning if residual sedation persists. Put anyone overly sedated/unconscious in the recovery position and seek medical help; this is standard depressant HR reflected in TripSit and DrugWise resources.\n8) Names/brands/slang: Common brand/colloquial names (Quaalude, Sopor, Mandrax, Ludes/714s) are documented in the Erowid vault; including them improves cross-referencing and counterfeit awareness.\n9) Data quality: Many contemporary details (dosage in illicit contexts, effect timings) derive from user reports and HR archives; we therefore label tolerance and some PK elements as low-to-anecdotal quality and encourage drug checking for identification.\n\nAdditional harm-reduction notes: Illicit tablets/powders may contain benzodiazepines, sedating antihistamines, or other depressants; assume variability and test where possible. Escalating to 'strong/heavy' ranges substantially increases ataxia, amnesia, and respiratory compromise; do not combine with any other downer. Consider spacing uses by at least several days to a week to reduce tolerance and risk of dose escalation. Keep sessions in a safe environment with a sober sitter if new to the drug. If dependent or using daily, do not stop abruptly; seek medical support for tapering. These points synthesize the above sources and widely accepted HR practice for depressants. ",

Concomitant or closely timed use (up to ~15 weeks after last dose, reflecting the long half-life) with halofantrine or ketoconazole is specifically warned against due to life‑threatening QTc prolongation; other QT‑affecting drugs warrant caution. A history of major psychiatric disorders (depression, GAD, psychosis, schizophrenia) or seizures is a contraindication to prophylactic use; hypersensitivity to quinine/quinidine is also a contraindication. Due to vestibular and neuropsychiatric risks, use caution with activities requiring alertness and fine motor control (driving, piloting, operating machinery, diving). Start prophylaxis at least 1 week before travel (2 weeks often recommended when feasible) to assess tolerability; continue for 4 weeks after return. Food increases absorption (~40%); take weekly doses with food and water, and avoid alcohol around dosing to reduce CNS side effects. Mefloquine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a P‑gp substrate/inhibitor; strong CYP3A4 inhibitors raise exposure and inducers (e.g., rifampin) lower exposure and may compromise efficacy. With chronic/long‑term use, liver enzyme elevations occur in a subset of users; periodic LFT monitoring is advised in prolonged courses and elimination is prolonged in hepatic impairment. Women and individuals with low BMI may be at higher risk for certain neuropsychiatric adverse effects in some cohorts; concurrent alcohol or other chronic medications has been associated with increased adverse event reporting. Breastmilk contains low mefloquine concentrations insufficient to protect an infant; breastfeeding infants require their own antimalarial prophylaxis where indicated.",

    "notes": "4-AcO-DET likely deacetylates in vivo to 4-HO-DET (ethocin), so potency, onset, and duration can vary with metabolism; users report both short (2–4 h) and longer (6–8 h) courses. Anecdotal reports describe stronger, shorter effects via intranasal or smoked routes, but these also carry more irritation and unpredictability; oral is the most characterized and generally lowest risk ROA. Like other 4-substituted tryptamines, nausea and GI unease can occur, particularly on the come-up; fasting 3–4 h and using ginger/antiemetic strategies may help. Avoid mixing with MAOIs, tramadol, DXM, or linezolid due to serotonin toxicity risk; lithium with psychedelics has repeatedly been linked with seizures and severe adverse reactions in community reports. SSRIs/SNRIs and some antipsychotics may attenuate psychedelic effects, but they can still contribute to serotonergic burden; effects can be unpredictable. Misrepresentation in the gray/illicit market is a documented risk (e.g., tryptamines sold as psilocybin or vice versa); reagent testing (Ehrlich for indoles) and lab drug checking reduce this risk, although reagents cannot confirm exact identity. Store away from heat, moisture, and light; 4-AcO esters can hydrolyze over time to 4-HO analogs—color changes (tanning/darkening) have been reported alongside retained potency, but degradation is formulation- and storage-dependent. Tolerance builds rapidly after a single session and decays over about 1–2 weeks; cross-tolerance exists with other classical psychedelics (psilocin/psilocybin, LSD, other 4-sub tryptamines). Set and setting strongly influence outcomes; a trusted sober sitter, safe environment, and clear intentions reduce risk of panic and dangerous behavior. Seek urgent medical help for signs of serotonin toxicity (agitation, hyperthermia, tremor/clonus, confusion), chest pain, persistent vomiting, seizures, or severe confusion; disclose all substances to responders.",

    "notes": "Estradiol is a systemic estrogen used for menopausal therapy, hypogonadism, and as part of gender-affirming hormone therapy; local vaginal products have minimal systemic absorption and generally do not carry systemic estrogen risks at low doses. Unopposed systemic estrogen increases endometrial hyperplasia/cancer risk in people with an intact uterus; co-administer an appropriate progestogen or use combined products. Oral estrogen increases hepatic protein synthesis (e.g., clotting factors), raising VTE risk—risk is highest in the first year; transdermal estradiol shows far less impact on coagulation markers and is preferred in patients with VTE risk factors or hypertriglyceridemia. Estrogen therapy can increase the risk of gallbladder disease; transdermal routes mitigate first-pass hepatic effects relative to oral. Estrogens raise TBG and other binding globulins, which can increase total thyroid and cortisol measurements without necessarily changing free fractions; hypothyroid patients may need higher levothyroxine doses after starting systemic estrogen. In people on lamotrigine, estrogen-containing therapies can lower lamotrigine levels (via UGT induction), risking seizure or mood relapse—monitor symptoms/levels and adjust lamotrigine as needed. Avoid supraphysiological estradiol dosing; higher oral doses increase thrombotic risk without clear added benefit; consider non-oral routes to minimize hepatic effects. Monitor: blood pressure, lipids (particularly triglycerides with oral estrogen), liver enzymes if indicated, prolactin (mild increases are common; rare macroprolactinomas reported with high-dose exposure), and for signs of VTE (unilateral leg swelling, chest pain, dyspnea). Smoking, older age, obesity, prolonged immobility, known thrombophilia, and prior VTE elevate risk; address modifiable risks and prefer transdermal route when systemic estrogen is needed. For IM esters, expect peak levels in days 2–7 and a decline over 1–3 weeks; dose timing can be adjusted to reduce symptom cycling; never inject IV.",

Start with 3–5 mg to assess sensitivity and avoid redosing within the first 2 hours to reduce risk of headaches, irritability, or insomnia. Insomnia is more likely with late-day dosing; avoid taking after mid-afternoon until you understand your response. Headaches are reported and often ascribed by users to cholinergic imbalance; while some find choline supplements helpful, controlled evidence is limited—add only if a consistent personal benefit is observed and keep doses modest. Combination with alcohol has produced unpleasant and risky experiences for some (confusion, dysphoria); if mixing, use minimal alcohol and avoid escalating either substance. Co-administration with phenibut or other CNS depressants can unpredictably blunt or intensify effects—space uses by at least 12–24 hours and avoid first-time combinations. Intranasal use is not recommended due to local irritation and uncertain bioavailability; oral or sublingual routes are safer and sufficient. If using daily, consider cycling (e.g., several weeks on followed by a similar or longer break) to limit tolerance and evaluate ongoing need; data are anecdotal and long-term safety is not established. Avoid in pregnancy/breastfeeding and in individuals with uncontrolled anxiety or sleep disorders until a cautious single low-dose trial in a safe setting demonstrates tolerability. Do not drive or operate machinery on first use or after dose changes, given interindividual variability and occasional paradoxical anxiety or sedation.",

Discontinue and seek medical advice if any occur. Evidence includes emergency department data and labeling summaries.\n• Next‑day impairment (memory, reaction time, driving) can persist, especially with extended‑release forms and higher doses. Patients should avoid driving or hazardous tasks the following morning if not fully alert.\n• Take immediately before bed with the intention and ability to sleep 7–8 hours (4+ hours for low‑dose sublingual “middle‑of‑the‑night” products). Redosing during the night greatly increases amnesia and complex behaviors.\n• Women generally have higher exposure from the same dose due to lower clearance; many regulators and labels recommend lower initial doses for women. Elderly patients and those with hepatic impairment also have increased exposure and fall risk; they typically require lower doses and careful monitoring.\n• Food delays absorption and may prolong residual effects; for fastest onset and least next‑day impairment take on an empty stomach and do not combine with alcohol.\n• Avoid combining with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzos, GHB, barbiturates, gabapentinoids, sedating antihistamines/antipsychotics); these combinations increase amnesia, accidental injury, respiratory depression, and overdose risk.\n• Dependence and withdrawal can occur (anxiety, tremor, rebound insomnia; seizures have been reported after high‑dose, prolonged use). Do not abruptly stop after chronic/heavy use; seek medical guidance for a taper.\n• Hepatic impairment can prolong zolpidem half‑life to ~10 hours on average (wide range), increasing next‑day impairment and accumulation risk; dose reductions are warranted and extended‑release should be avoided in significant impairment.\n• Serious allergic reactions (angioedema/anaphylaxis) are reported; discontinue and seek urgent care if swelling or breathing problems occur.\n• Use extreme caution in sleep apnea, chronic respiratory disease, or with opioid therapy due to additive respiratory depression and hypoxemia risk.\n• Extended‑release tablets must not be crushed or split; crushing/insufflating tablets or using non‑oral routes adds risk from excipients and rapid CNS depression without improving safety or outcomes.",

Onset can be subtle; avoid redosing during the first 2–3 hours as tolerance rises quickly and effects may surge later. People with seizure disorders, on lithium, or taking serotonergic drugs (SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, tramadol, DXM, 5-HTP) should avoid DiPT due to seizure or serotonin-toxicity concerns. Set/setting and a sober sitter are recommended—auditory scene distortions can impair communication and situational awareness. Use drug checking: reagent tests help confirm a tryptamine (e.g., Ehrlich), but laboratory confirmation via GC/MS (e.g., DrugsData) best verifies identity.

    "notes": "Reasoning for harm-reduction additions (with sources): 1) Fluconazole is a clinically used antifungal and a known inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. This mechanistically explains many drug–drug interactions; classing it under medical use (not a supplement) and emphasizing enzyme inhibition reduces interaction-related harm. Source: DrugBank BioInteractors lists fluconazole as an inhibitor of CYP3A4/2C9/2C19 and ABCB1, supporting interaction caution. 2) Opioid combinations: fluconazole can raise levels of methadone (trial specifically assessing the interaction) and has a published case report with fentanyl; both raise risk of oversedation, respiratory depression, and QT prolongation. Sources: DrugBank clinical trial listing for fluconazole–methadone pharmacokinetics; drugs-forum abstract of a fentanyl–fluconazole case report in Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 3) QT prolongation risk: Azole antifungals including fluconazole appear in studies of torsades de pointes/QT-prolonging inpatient medications; combining with other QT-prolongers (e.g., macrolides, fluoroquinolones, methadone, certain antiarrhythmics) increases risk. Source: Registry-based clinical study listing of drugs associated with QT/TdP risk including fluconazole. 4) Pregnancy: Up-to-date NIH/NCBI guideline text advises avoiding oral fluconazole in the first trimester—including single 150 mg doses—because of increased risk of spontaneous abortion; higher cumulative doses (>300 mg) associated with higher stillbirth risk in registry analyses; characteristic embryopathy reported with chronic 400 mg/day or more. This is high-stakes safety information that directly reduces fetal risk. Source: NIH/NCBI Opportunistic Infections guideline PDF (2025 update). 5) Long half-life and accumulation: fluconazole’s long elimination half-life (roughly day-scale) means serial self-redosing can silently accumulate and magnify interaction risks; spacing and avoiding unadvised repeats reduces adverse events. This aligns with standard pharmacokinetic references and the user-supplied half-life range. For conservative harm reduction, treat it as a once-daily agent unless a clinician instructs otherwise. 6) Hepatic considerations: Although severe hepatotoxicity is uncommon, azoles carry labeled liver risk; avoiding heavy alcohol and seeking care for jaundice, dark urine, severe fatigue, or mucocutaneous rash is prudent. This general precaution reduces rare but serious outcomes. 7) Renal function: Because clinically meaningful renal elimination occurs and dose adjustments are made in practice for reduced kidney function on multi-day regimens, people with kidney disease should not self-dose and should confirm adjustments with a prescriber. 8) Specific interaction flags were grouped by severity based on mechanism (potent QT-prolongers and narrow-therapeutic-index substrates placed higher) and the availability of human data (trial/case report) to mitigate the most consequential risks first. Where only mechanistic plausibility exists, items were placed under “caution.” Together these changes convert general info into actionable harm reduction focused on avoiding high-risk combinations, pregnancy exposure, and stealth accumulation.\n\nPractical harm-reduction guidance: - Verify indication and dosing with a clinician; don’t use fluconazole to self-treat vague “yeast overgrowth.” - Disclose all meds, including methadone, fentanyl, benzodiazepines, warfarin, sulfonylureas, and QT-prolonging drugs. - Avoid combining with other QT-prolongers when possible; if necessary, follow prescriber monitoring advice. - Avoid heavy alcohol and stop the drug promptly for severe rash, mucosal lesions, jaundice, or unexplained severe fatigue. - If pregnant or trying to conceive, avoid oral fluconazole in the first trimester; prefer topical therapy unless a specialist advises otherwise. - With repeated dosing, don’t “top up”—the long half-life means today’s dose stacks with prior doses.",

    "notes": "Pemoline is a CNS stimulant formerly used for ADHD and narcolepsy; FDA approval was withdrawn in 2005 after reports of acute liver failure and death, despite earlier monitoring recommendations. Avoid alcohol entirely while on pemoline; DrugBank explicitly lists alcohol avoidance and caffeine limitation, and alcohol adds independent liver risk. Baseline and periodic liver function testing is prudent if any exposure occurs; watch for warning signs of DILI (e.g., right‑upper‑quadrant pain, dark urine, pruritus, jaundice, prolonged nausea/fatigue) and stop immediately if they appear. Do not re‑challenge after suspected pemoline‑related liver injury due to risk of recurrence with greater severity. Roughly half of an oral dose is renally excreted unchanged and the serum half‑life is near 12 hours, so redosing stacks substantially; spacing doses and avoiding late‑day dosing reduces insomnia and overstimulation. Given limited euphoric effects relative to amphetamines, users may be tempted to escalate doses; this increases adverse effect risk without reliably improving therapeutic benefit. Combining with MAOIs or other stimulants increases cardiovascular/central adverse events and is discouraged by interaction guides; if any combination is unavoidable in clinical contexts, specialist oversight is essential. Because pemoline is or has been controlled (e.g., CSA Schedule IV historically) and withdrawn in many markets, products circulating online may be mislabelled; reagent testing will not assess hepatotoxicity, so sourcing does not mitigate this core risk. Consider alternative, better‑characterized treatments where available; if used off‑label, employ the lowest effective dose for the shortest feasible duration and schedule rest days.",

    "notes": "DXM polistirex is an extended‑release resin complex; its slower, flatter absorption commonly produces a weaker peak with a much longer tail than DXM HBr. Because come‑up may take 1–3 hours, premature redosing can stack exposures and lead to unexpectedly long, dysphoric, or anxious trips; wait at least 4–6 hours before considering any additional dosing and avoid it entirely with ER products. CYP2D6 genetics and inhibitors strongly change exposure: poor metabolizers (≈9%) can have ~8× higher bioavailability and ~8× longer half‑life than extensive metabolizers, producing unusually prolonged effects and higher toxicity risk; potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion) can mimic PM status. Avoid combination OTCs: acetaminophen (hepatotoxicity above ~3–4 g/day), first‑gen antihistamines (anticholinergic delirium; QT), doxylamine/diphenhydramine (delirium/seizure risk), guaifenesin (severe nausea/vomiting), and decongestants (cardiovascular strain). Mixing with serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs/SNRIs/MAOIs), tramadol, linezolid, St. John’s wort, or MDMA increases serotonin‑toxicity risk (agitation, hyperthermia, clonus, diaphoresis)—seek emergency care if these occur. Do not attempt to defeat the polistirex coating (e.g., crushing/acid tricks or crude ‘extractions’); release becomes unpredictable and may not convert to free DXM. Expect impaired coordination and judgment for the rest of the day and often into the next morning—do not drive, swim, or perform hazardous tasks for at least 12–24 hours after significant doses. Many syrups contain sorbitol and other excipients that can cause GI upset, dehydration, and electrolyte loss—sip oral fluids with electrolytes and avoid heavy physical exertion. Start low if on any psychiatric medication or with a history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, significant hypertension, or liver disease; dissociatives can precipitate mania/psychosis and increase BP/HR. Space use 2–4 weeks or longer to manage tolerance and reduce compulsive patterns; frequent redosing increases adverse mental health outcomes. Always read the exact product label: ER bottles often state ‘dextromethorphan polistirex equivalent to 30 mg DXM HBr per 5 mL’; this is a labeling equivalence for cough dosing, not a guarantee of equal recreational effect. If severe agitation, hyperthermia, rigid muscles, confusion, or seizures occur, this may signal serotonin toxicity or severe overdose—seek urgent medical help and avoid anticholinergic sedatives unless directed by a clinician.",

    "notes": "Esketamine is the S‑enantiomer of ketamine and an FDA‑/EU‑approved nasal antidepressant; it causes dose‑dependent dissociation, cognitive/motor impairment, and transient hypertension. Intranasal bioavailability is ~48% with a 20–40 minute Tmax, so redosing too quickly can overshoot into heavier sedation or a hole-like state. It acutely elevates blood pressure and heart rate, peaking ~40 minutes and lasting up to ~4 hours, so people with uncontrolled hypertension, significant cardiovascular disease, recent stroke, intracranial/intraocular pressure problems, or serious head injury should avoid unsupervised use. Combining with alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, or GHB/GBL amplifies sedation and airway compromise; if someone becomes unresponsive or vomits, place them in the recovery position and seek help. Chronic/frequent use can damage the urinary tract (ketamine cystitis), presenting with urgency, frequency, dysuria, hematuria, and sometimes severe bladder contraction; stopping early improves outcomes and heavy users have required invasive treatments in severe cases. Snorting irritates mucosa—use finely crushed material, alternate nostrils, avoid sharing snorting tools, and rinse gently with saline after sessions to reduce epistaxis and infection risk. Use seated or lying down in a safe space with a trusted sober person if doses may impair mobility, and avoid driving or hazardous tasks until fully recovered. Unregulated markets see mis‑sold powders (e.g., ketamine sold as cocaine or 2C‑B), so drug checking is strongly advised to prevent unexpected dissociation and risky redosing. Outside clinical settings, IM is generally safer than IV if injecting at all, but both require sterile equipment, accurate measurement, and understanding of rapid onset. Nausea is common—avoid heavy meals for 1–2 hours beforehand and have antiemetic strategies planned if sensitive. Tolerance builds quickly; spacing sessions by at least several days and avoiding daily use markedly reduces compulsive redosing, bladder risk, and loss of effect.",

    "notes": "Ibogaine and its active metabolite noribogaine inhibit cardiac hERG channels at clinically relevant concentrations, prolonging ventricular repolarization (QT interval) and predisposing to torsades de pointes; adverse cardiac events can appear days after a single dose due to noribogaine’s long half-life. Pre-dose screening (12-lead ECG, QTc, heart history) and correction of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium) materially reduce arrhythmia risk. High-variability plant products (root bark/TA) complicate dosing; ibogaine HCl allows weight-based calculations (typical ‘flood’ 15–25 mg/kg) but still requires continuous monitoring and ready access to advanced cardiac care. Significant ataxia, vertigo, bradycardia, and vomiting are common during peaks; patients should remain supine with assistance to minimize falls and aspiration. Because noribogaine is a strong SERT inhibitor and ibogaine/noribogaine are metabolized by polymorphic CYP2D6, poor metabolizers or those taking CYP2D6 inhibitors can experience prolonged exposure and QT risk; dose reduction and extended monitoring are prudent. Combining ibogaine with methadone and other potent QT-prolongers is a well-documented hazard; most clinical protocols require opioid transitions/washouts and continuous telemetry. Stimulants (including cocaine/amphetamines) amplify cardiac risk during and for several days post-dose; strict abstinence is recommended pre/post. Anti-emetics like ondansetron also prolong QT; if anti-nausea medication is clinically necessary, it should be selected and monitored by medical staff. Post-ibogaine, opioid tolerance often drops; relapse can therefore be more lethal—harm-reduction planning (naloxone, support, follow-up) is essential. Legal status varies widely; in many countries ibogaine is controlled or unapproved for treatment—unregulated settings may lack the monitoring capacity required for safe administration.",

During fentanyl patch therapy, a longer wait (48–72 h after removal) is advised. Alternative initiation strategies exist (e.g., low‑dose ‘micro‑induction’ while continuing a full agonist) when standard induction is not tolerated; these should be clinician‑directed. Combination products with naloxone have negligible naloxone effect when used sublingually/buccally as directed but can precipitate severe withdrawal if the product is dissolved and injected. Buprenorphine’s high receptor affinity can block other opioids for 24–72 hours; attempts to ‘break through’ with more opioids increase overdose risk, especially as buprenorphine levels decline. Sedative co‑use (benzodiazepines, alcohol, Z‑drugs, other depressants) greatly magnifies respiratory depression risk; treatment should not be withheld solely for benzodiazepine co‑use, but dosing and monitoring must be cautious. Proper sublingual technique improves effect and reduces redosing: let the film/tablet fully dissolve (often 3–10 minutes), avoid eating/drinking/smoking for ~30 minutes, and wait ≥2 hours before any reassessment dose. Transdermal patches are for analgesia in opioid‑tolerant patients; do not cut, chew, heat, or extract—misuse can cause uncontrolled release and fatal overdose. Accidental pediatric exposures (films, tablets, patches) can be lethal from a single dose; store locked and dispose securely. Hepatic impairment raises risk of toxicity; monitor liver enzymes periodically and avoid combination product in severe hepatic dysfunction. In buprenorphine overdose, reversal may require higher or repeated naloxone dosing and prolonged supportive care due to buprenorphine’s high affinity and long half‑life.",

    "notes": "- PEA is preferentially metabolized by monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), leading to a very short duration and low oral bioavailability; any MAO-B inhibition can dramatically increase exposure and physiological impact. This is the central harm-reduction issue: avoid all MAOIs (including Parkinson’s drugs and the antibiotic linezolid).\n- Selective MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline, safinamide) and nonselective/irreversible MAOIs (phenelzine, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid) can potentiate PEA to a degree that risks severe hypertension, hyperthermia, or cerebrovascular events; this risk exists even at small PEA doses when MAO is inhibited.\n- Linezolid is a reversible, nonselective MAOI used as an antibiotic; combining PEA with linezolid can precipitate dangerous pressor responses and should be strictly avoided.\n- Because the psychoactive window is brief, some users escalate to gram-level oral doses or engage in frequent redosing cycles; harm-reduction priorities include not stacking stimulants, monitoring blood pressure/heart rate, maintaining hydration, and stopping at the first signs of severe headache, chest pain, or marked flushing. These redosing patterns are consistently reported in harm-reduction forums and align with the known indirect sympathomimetic profile of PEA.\n- PEA primarily acts as an endogenous trace amine/TAAR1 agonist and an indirect sympathomimetic (catecholamine-releasing); expect tachycardia, blood pressure elevation, and anxiety at higher doses, especially with co-stimulants. Individuals with cardiovascular disease should avoid use.\n- Food-derived/background PEA (e.g., chocolate) is trivial compared to supplemental doses; however, in the presence of MAOI therapy even trace amines can become clinically significant, reinforcing the strict MAOI-avoidance guidance.\n- Urine drug testing: cross-reactivity data indicate β-phenethylamine can interfere with some assays; although not usually targeted, unexpected results should be confirmed with specific methods (e.g., GC/MS).\n- There is no established therapeutic dosing for psychoactive purposes. If an individual nevertheless chooses to experiment, conservative spacing (weeks) and strict avoidance of MAOIs and stimulant stacks are critical to reduce cumulative cardiovascular strain and compulsive redosing risk.

    "notes": "- Ephedrine is a mixed-acting sympathomimetic: it directly agonizes alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors and indirectly releases norepinephrine; this underlies its pressor, bronchodilatory, and tachycardic effects. This mechanism also explains rapid tolerance/tachyphylaxis with repeated dosing. [Cited: DrugBank DB01364].\n- Oral dosing has reasonably consistent community and clinical consensus; start at the low end and avoid frequent redosing to limit tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety, and insomnia. Deaths and severe events have been reported at higher or repeated doses and during exertion. [Cited: Erowid dosage page; AHRQ review].\n- Half-life averages about 6 hours but varies with urinary pH; at pH ~6.3 t½ ~6 h and at pH ~5 t½ ~3 h. Acidifying urine to hasten elimination is not recommended in toxicity. Plan timing to avoid nighttime insomnia. [Cited: Erowid Ephedra overview].\n- Populations at higher risk: people with hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, ischemic heart disease/heart failure, hyperthyroidism, angle-closure glaucoma, urinary retention/BPH, and renal impairment; pregnancy and lactation require caution or avoidance outside medical indications. [Cited: StatPearls Ephedrine].\n- Avoid combining with MAO inhibitors (including linezolid/methylene blue): can precipitate hypertensive crisis. If discontinuing an MAOI, wait at least 14 days before ephedrine use. Seek urgent care for severe headache, chest pain, or neurological symptoms. [Cited: StatPearls MAOIs; StatPearls Ephedrine].\n- Combining with caffeine increases adverse-event frequency (palpitations, autonomic hyperactivity, anxiety); use conservative doses, vigilant hydration, and avoid strenuous heat/exertion on the stack. [Cited: AHRQ ephedra/ephedrine+caffeine review].\n- Hydration: during stimulation, sip ~300–500 mL water per hour and include electrolytes if sweating; avoid alcohol which masks intoxication and increases dehydration risk. Saferparty provides similar guidance. [Cited: Saferparty factsheet].\n- Insufflation is higher risk than oral due to potent local vasoconstriction and mucosal dryness/irritation; expect disproportionate cardiovascular stimulation for marginal subjective benefit. If used despite risks: keep doses low, space lines, rotate nostrils, and rinse with isotonic saline after use. Prefer oral route for lower harm. [Mechanistic rationale + general harm reduction; Saferparty nasal hygiene guidance].\n- Renal clearance is predominant and can be slowed in renal impairment; dose accumulation increases adverse effects. People with kidney disease should be especially cautious and avoid repeat dosing without medical oversight. [Cited: StatPearls Ephedrine].\n- Adulteration: ephedrine is sometimes detected as an adulterant in cocaine samples, creating unexpectedly strong stimulant mixes that elevate cardiac risk; drug checking is advised. [Cited: Saferparty warning].\n- Salt forms: dosing by mass depends on the salt. Ephedrine HCl contains ~0.82 g free base per 1 g salt; ephedrine sulfate contains ~0.77 g free base per 1 g salt (approximate stoichiometric calculation). Adjust if switching forms to avoid inadvertent over- or under-dosing. [Cited: DrugBank salt entries].\n- Exercise/heat: case series link ephedra/ephedrine use to serious cardiovascular and neurologic events, especially with exertion/heat. Avoid heavy exercise and hot environments on days you take ephedrine. [Cited: NCBI report on military personnel/safety reviews]. ",

    "notes": "Why this matters and how to reduce risk: 1) Human in‑vivo pharmacokinetics are unknown; an in‑vitro study in human liver microsomes found a long metabolic half‑life (~770 min ≈ 12.8 h), so redosing can stack and prolong sympathomimetic strain even if the subjective ‘rush’ fades. Space doses and avoid consecutive‑day use. 2) Mislabeling is common: multiple Swiss drug‑checking alerts found NEP sold as 3‑MMC; because NEP is active at much lower oral doses (≈20–50 mg vs 100–200 mg for 3‑MMC), substitution markedly increases overdose risk. Use accredited drug‑checking when possible; if not, start with a very small test dose and wait fully for effects. 3) Cardiovascular and hyperthermia risks are central with cathinones; clinical cases with NEP have included severe agitation, fever, rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. Avoid hot environments and intense exertion; take cooling breaks; sip isotonic fluids (not excessive water) and replace electrolytes during prolonged activity. 4) Seizure risk is heightened by co‑factors (sleep deprivation, dehydration, tramadol, bupropion, stimulant stacking). Avoid these combinations and ensure sleep/nutrition before and after sessions. 5) Intranasal dosing produces a steeper rise, more peripheral side effects and greater compulsion than oral; vaporizing/inhalation reports often describe very short cycles with strong urges to redose and respiratory irritation—prefer oral if you choose to use at all. 6) Set maximum session amounts in advance, measure doses with a 0.001 g scale, and avoid ‘chasing’ diminishing returns—compulsion is a common pathway to harm. 7) Because NEP is frequently mis‑sold, reagents may not reliably distinguish it from other cathinones; lab drug‑checking (FTIR/GC‑MS/LC‑HRMS) is the safest way to identify contents. 8) Aftercare: expect a dysphoric ‘crash’; plan nutrition, hydration and sleep; consider a non‑sedating day off stimulants for at least 14+ days to let tolerance and cardiovascular strain normalize. 9) Seek urgent care for red‑flag symptoms: persistent chest pain, severe headache, confusion/delirium, temperature >38.5°C (101.3°F), rigid muscles, dark urine, or inability to keep fluids down.",

    "notes": "Harm-reduction reasoning and key points that informed this profile: 1) Dose and duration are highly variable; typical oral onset is within 5–45 minutes and peak CNS stimulation occurs around 30–75 minutes. Effects can persist for several hours, with residual stimulation and sleep disruption lasting into the next day at higher doses. 2) Serious toxicity is uncommon but possible; human fatalities are reported mostly from intentional or accidental ingestion of concentrated powders/shots, with estimated lethal ranges around 150–200 mg/kg and severe toxicity at gram-level intakes. 3) Half-life averages about 3–7 hours but is highly context-dependent: shorter in smokers and noticeably longer in late pregnancy and in users on oral contraceptives; neonates clear caffeine extremely slowly. 4) CYP1A2 inhibitors (notably fluvoxamine, and several quinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin) can substantially increase caffeine exposure, raising the risk of side effects (jitters, tachycardia, insomnia) at usual doses. 5) Alcohol plus caffeine is risky because caffeine can mask sedation and intoxication cues without reducing impairment; people may unintentionally over-consume alcohol. 6) Combining high-dose caffeine with other stimulants increases cardiovascular load (tachycardia, hypertension); drug-checking alerts frequently find caffeine mixed into stimulant powders/tablets, which can lead to redosing and unintended high stimulant loads. 7) During pregnancy and lactation, prudent upper limits are lower than for nonpregnant adults; caffeine crosses the placenta and appears in breast milk, and infants—especially preterm—metabolize it slowly. 8) For sleep health, avoid substantial caffeine within at least 6 hours of bedtime; even earlier cutoffs may be needed for slow metabolizers or those on CYP1A2 inhibitors. 9) Long-term daily use leads to tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome that is typically mild-to-moderate and resolves over several days; tapering intake can reduce severity. 10) People with anxiety disorders, symptomatic arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, GERD/ulcer disease, seizure disorders, or significant hepatic impairment should use caution or lower doses. 11) Changes in smoking status can alter caffeine metabolism within days; former smokers often need to reduce caffeine to avoid side effects. 12) Hydration: caffeine is a mild diuretic; habitual users develop tolerance to diuretic effects—drink to thirst rather than overhydrate. 13) Prefer measured-dose products over bulk powders; if using tablets/capsules, space redoses to avoid stacking from delayed absorption.",

Co-ingestion with alcohol or other depressants (opioids, benzodiazepines, GHB/GBL) markedly increases risk of loss of consciousness, respiratory depression, aspiration, and death—avoid these combinations entirely and place any unresponsive person in the recovery position while seeking emergency care. Chloral hydrate is metabolized primarily by alcohol dehydrogenase to trichloroethanol (active) and further to trichloroacetic acid; genetic variation and concurrent alcohol use can meaningfully alter both potency and duration between individuals. In cirrhosis or hepatic decompensation, chloral hydrate can precipitate or worsen hepatic encephalopathy; avoid use in significant liver disease and in untreated sleep apnea. Cardiac irritability/arrhythmia can occur in overdose and in susceptible individuals; those with structural heart disease or on other QT-/rhythm‑affecting drugs should avoid nonmedical use. Residual psychomotor impairment may persist into the next day due to metabolite half-lives; do not drive or operate machinery for at least a full night after dosing. Repeated frequent use rapidly builds tolerance and can cause dependence; withdrawal may begin within 12–24 hours after cessation in heavy users and may resemble alcohol/barbiturate withdrawal (including delirium)—medical supervision is strongly advised for dependent users. Oral and rectal routes can irritate mucosa; always dilute liquids and avoid concentrated solutions to reduce GI irritation; injection is strongly discouraged due to vein and tissue irritation. Products and syrups may vary in concentration; use an accurate milligram scale or clearly labeled pharmaceutical preparations to avoid dosing errors. Breast milk transfer occurs and may sedate infants; avoid during pregnancy and lactation unless medically supervised. If severe vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, confusion, or shallow breathing occur after use, seek emergency help immediately and avoid giving more depressants while awaiting care.",

    "notes": "Etonitazene is an ultra-potent benzimidazole opioid; class reports place it at roughly 1,000–1,500× morphine potency in animals, implying microgram-level human activity and an extreme overdose risk from tiny mismeasurements. It has appeared in the unregulated supply, sometimes sold as or alongside other opioids or as counterfeit pills; related etonitazene analogs have been detected in tablets marked as oxycodone. Nitazenes are often below the detection limits of common onsite spectrometers (e.g., FTIR at ~5% w/w), and available nitazene test strips may not reliably detect all analogs; lab-based drug checking is recommended. Mixed-depressant use (benzodiazepines, alcohol, GHB/GBL, Z-drugs, barbiturates) greatly increases the risk of rapid, profound respiratory depression and death. Co-use with gabapentinoids (gabapentin/pregabalin) is epidemiologically associated with higher opioid-related mortality and should be avoided. In suspected opioid poisoning, naloxone should be administered promptly; multiple repeat doses and prolonged monitoring can be required because nitazenes may outlast naloxone, with risk of renarcotization after initial reversal. Fentanyl test strips detect fentanyl-class opioids; they do not identify which nitazene is present and onsite tools can miss nitazenes—negative results do not guarantee safety. Never “eyeball” or guess amounts; microgram-active materials require precision handling, and insufflation or injection sharply elevates risk. Avoid using alone; ensure bystanders can recognize opioid overdose (unresponsiveness, slow or stopped breathing, pinpoint pupils) and can administer naloxone while calling emergency services.",

    "notes": "Ibotenic acid is an excitatory amino acid and a known neurotoxin in laboratory settings; it acts primarily as an agonist at NMDA and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors, and a proportion decarboxylates in vivo or during preparation to muscimol, a potent GABA-A agonist that mediates most desired Amanita effects. Drying and/or heating Amanita material decarboxylates ibotenic acid to muscimol; avoiding raw or under-prepared material meaningfully reduces nausea, dysautonomia, and confusion. Onset can be markedly delayed (often up to 2–3 hours), so redosing during the come-up substantially increases the risk of oversedation, delirium, and emesis later in the session. Clinical series show a characteristic mixture of GI upset (nausea/vomiting), CNS depression (somnolence, confusion), and CNS excitation (agitation, hallucinations); severe cases may require airway protection and benzodiazepines under medical care. Both ibotenic acid and muscimol are rapidly absorbed and readily excreted in urine; laboratory confirmation is possible within hours of ingestion, which also explains historical reports of urine recycling—this does not imply safety and is not a harm-reduction practice. Potency varies widely between Amanita species, locations, and seasons; even adjacent mushrooms can differ substantially, so dosing strategies based on mushroom count or unstandardized extracts are unreliable. Do not drive, swim, or perform hazardous tasks the day of use and consider residual impairment the next day; have a sober sitter to manage sudden somnolence or disorientation. Avoid combining with alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, or other sedatives because muscimol-mediated sedation and vomiting increase aspiration and injury risks. Children appear more prone to severe presentations (e.g., ataxia, seizures) after Amanita exposures; pregnant or breastfeeding individuals and those with seizure history should avoid entirely. In the U.S., Amanita muscaria and its constituents are not federally controlled substances, but the FDA has stated that Amanita muscaria and its constituents (including muscimol and ibotenic acid) are not GRAS food additives, and retail products are unregulated; mislabeling and variable decarboxylation are common. Seek urgent care if severe agitation, persistent vomiting, chest pain, seizures, or inability to stay awake occur; clinicians commonly use supportive care with benzodiazepines for agitation or seizures and observation until resolution.",

    "notes": "Potency estimates for metonitazene vary by source and matrix; drug checking data has described it as roughly fentanyl-strength in some periods and up to ~4× fentanyl in others, underscoring high uncertainty across batches. It has increasingly appeared as an adulterant in samples not expected to contain high‑potency opioids (e.g., counterfeit oxycodone/“Percocet”, hydromorphone, and even cocaine/other non‑opioids), so assume unknown powders or pressed pills may contain a nitazene. Nitazenes, including metonitazene, are frequently found with other depressants such as benzodiazepine‑related drugs and veterinary tranquilizers (xylazine, medetomidine), which dramatically increase the risk of life‑threatening respiratory depression. Naloxone reverses nitazene overdoses but multiple sequential doses are often required; continue to administer naloxone every 2–3 minutes until breathing improves and emergency help arrives. Because fentanyl test strips do not detect nitazenes, a negative FTS result does not rule them out; some jurisdictions now distribute nitazene‑specific strips, but availability and sensitivity vary. Due to sub‑milligram potency and uneven distribution in powders, never eyeball; if handling any powder, use an accurate milligram scale and volumetric dilution to reduce hot‑spot risk. Avoid using alone; ensure someone can monitor breathing, place the person in the recovery position if unresponsive, and call emergency services promptly at the first sign of overdose (slow/absent breathing, cyanosis, unresponsiveness). Avoid combining with any sedatives (alcohol, benzos, gabapentinoids) and beware that stimulants can mask overdose signs without reducing respiratory depression. Metonitazene’s half‑life in humans is not well-established; observe for re‑sedation (“re‑narcotization”) after naloxone and seek medical monitoring. Not clinically approved for medical use; first identified in the unregulated drug supply around 2021 and subsequently implicated in fatalities in multiple countries. ",

    "notes": "Flurazepam is rapidly absorbed but acts as a prodrug to N-desalkylflurazepam, which has a very long elimination half-life (roughly 47–100 hours), so effects can accumulate across nights and significantly impair next-day cognition, coordination, and reaction time. Driving impairment and increased accident risk are documented with benzodiazepines in general, and risk rises sharply if alcohol is also used; avoid driving or operating machinery not only the night of dosing but also the next day if residual sedation is present. Older adults eliminate benzodiazepines more slowly and face higher risks of falls, confusion, and amnesia; use the lowest dose possible and avoid long-acting hypnotics in this group where alternatives exist. Combining flurazepam with opioids or alcohol greatly increases the risk of life‑threatening respiratory depression; if any opioids are in use, do not take flurazepam and ensure naloxone availability in the household. Avoid combining with other CNS depressants such as GHB/GBL, barbiturates, or sedating antihistamines; even cannabis can meaningfully increase psychomotor impairment. People with pre‑existing respiratory disorders (e.g., OSA, COPD) are more susceptible to hypoventilation at sedative doses; medical oversight is advised, and flurazepam is generally a poor choice in these settings. Physical dependence can develop within weeks; never stop abruptly after repeated use—coordinate a slow, individualized taper with a clinician to mitigate severe withdrawal and seizure risk. In breastfeeding, flurazepam is generally not preferred due to long-acting metabolites and a report of infant sedation during multi‑drug exposure; if used, infants should be monitored for excessive drowsiness and poor feeding. In overdose, supportive care is first-line; flumazenil is typically avoided outside select scenarios because it can precipitate seizures—particularly in benzodiazepine‑tolerant patients or mixed TCA overdoses. Due to widespread circulation of counterfeit ‘benzodiazepine’ tablets (sometimes containing potent nitazene opioids), avoid non‑pharmacy sources; if exposure is possible, use drug‑checking services where available and never mix with depressants. Space doses by at least 24–48 hours and avoid ‘booster’ redoses at night; apparent early wear‑off can reflect redistribution, while the active metabolite persists and will compound next-day effects.",

    "notes": "Aminorex is an amphetamine-like anorectic withdrawn after an epidemic of drug-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); this adverse effect can be severe and long-lasting. PAH risk appears linked to aminorex-class agents and is the major reason to avoid frequent or high-dose use; symptoms such as exertional breathlessness, chest pain, syncope, or blue-tinged lips warrant urgent medical evaluation. Duration is long relative to perceived euphoria, increasing the temptation to redose; plan a single measured dose and avoid stacking. Historical German brand Menocil tablets reportedly contained 14 mg aminorex fumarate; if using laboratory material, be aware that fumarate vs freebase salts differ in potency by mass. Combining with other stimulants or serotonergics increases risks of hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation and, in susceptible cases, serotonin toxicity. Avoid use if you have cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, prior PAH, or unexplained exertional symptoms; consider baseline and follow-up blood pressure checks during any session. Insufflation accelerates onset and raises BP spikes and nasal injury risk; oral use is typically safer on the nose and less compulsive. Hydration, electrolyte intake, and temperature control reduce hyperthermia risk; avoid prolonged dancing/overheating and take cool-down breaks. Bruxism (jaw clenching/teeth grinding) is common with stimulants; a mouthguard or chewing gum reduces dental damage, and magnesium glycinate (200–400 mg/day) may help some users. Because human pharmacokinetic data for aminorex are sparse, treat all dosage ranges as estimates and titrate cautiously with a calibrated milligram scale or volumetric dosing. Do not use on consecutive days; leave multi-week gaps (e.g., several weeks or longer) to reduce tolerance and, more importantly, to limit cumulative cardiopulmonary risk. Keep total session dose modest and avoid binges that extend wakefulness beyond one night to reduce psychosis and cardiovascular complication risk.",

    "notes": "Mechanism: primarily inhibits norepinephrine and dopamine transporters; much weaker serotonin effects relative to NET/DAT, which guides interaction risk (e.g., less serotonergic liability than amphetamines). Start with the low end of dosing, particularly in stimulant-naïve users, and avoid redosing because the 10–13 h half-life produces prolonged cardiovascular stimulation. Baseline and on-day checks of blood pressure and heart rate reduce risk; discontinue and seek care with chest pain, severe headache, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Avoid use with MAOIs or within 14 days of MAOI exposure due to risk of hypertensive crisis; this is a general rule for sympathomimetics. Avoid combining with other stimulants (including OTC decongestants) to limit additive tachycardia and hypertension. In those on SNRIs or other noradrenergic agents (atomoxetine, bupropion, many TCAs), additive increases in BP/HR and anxiety are more likely; if co-prescribed medically, dose conservatively and monitor vitals. For SSRI users, serotonin toxicity risk appears lower than with serotonergic stimulants, but agitation, anxiety, and insomnia may be amplified—treat as a caution combination. Dose early in the day; avoid late-afternoon/evening dosing to minimize sleep disruption. Take with or without food; taking 1 hour before meals is common in labels, and food may reduce GI upset. Hepatic metabolism suggests added caution with significant liver disease. Typical adverse effects include insomnia, dry mouth, palpitations, anxiety, and decreased appetite; severe events are uncommon at therapeutic doses but have included arrhythmias in isolated cases. Stay hydrated and maintain nutrition given strong appetite suppression; prolonged caloric deficit can worsen side effects.",

Once-daily morning dosing was used clinically; avoid same-day redosing because active metabolites persist for 14–24 h and cumulatively load the cardiovascular system. Expect measurable increases in heart rate and small BP rises on average; stop and seek care for chest pain, severe headache, palpitations, or marked BP elevations. Risk of serotonin syndrome increases if combined with MAOIs or other serotonergic agents; do not use within 14 days of an MAOI and avoid serotonergic combinations. Sibutramine and/or analogs are frequently found adulterating “slimming” teas, coffees, and capsules; treat any such product as potentially mislabeled—use only products confirmed by accredited labs or avoid entirely. Rare cases of drug-induced liver injury have been reported; avoid if you have active liver disease and stop if you develop pruritus, dark urine, jaundice, or right‑upper‑quadrant pain. Because it can cause insomnia, dose early in the day and avoid other stimulants (including heavy caffeine); maintain hydration, particularly with exercise or hot environments. Metabolized mainly by CYP3A4; strong inhibitors may raise exposure and strong inducers may reduce efficacy—be cautious and monitor for BP/HR or adverse changes.

Mislabeling raises dosing risk; confirm with instrumental drug checking when possible.\n• PubChem lists entries for both dimethoxy α‑PVP and 3',4'-dimethoxy‑α‑PHP, supporting the presence of both scaffolds on the market; do not assume which you have based on vendor naming or reagent tests alone.\n• Reagent kits have limited specificity for cathinones; Liebermann/Simons patterns can suggest a cathinone but cannot distinguish ring/side‑chain variants—avoid making dosage decisions from reagents; use lab drug checking (GC/MS, LC‑MS).\n• As a pyrrolidinophenone, expected pharmacology is potent dopamine/norepinephrine transporter inhibition with minimal SERT activity; risks include tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction (cold extremities), anxiety/paranoia, hyperthermia and, at high/extended doses, rhabdomyolysis.\n• Acute management (medical setting): benzodiazepines are first‑line for sympathomimetic toxicity (agitation, hypertension, hyperthermia, seizures). External cooling for hyperthermia; avoid self‑treating stimulant symptoms with beta‑blockers without clinical oversight due to potential unopposed α‑effects.\n• Chronic/behavioral risks: strong craving/redosing loops, sleep deprivation, weight loss, depressive ‘crash’, and stimulant psychosis—risk increases with binges/multi‑day use, as seen with MDPV/α‑PVP cases.\n• Routes: oral has the gentlest profile; insufflation can increase BP/vasoconstriction and irritate sinuses; inhalation (vaporizing) causes very rapid spikes, harsh smoke, and the highest compulsion—prefer oral if using at all.\n• Harm reduction: use an accurate 1 mg‑resolution scale; consider volumetric dosing for sub‑10 mg accuracy. Plan a hard cap on total session dose and number of redoses; set a time limit. Keep cool, avoid strenuous activity, sip electrolytes, and schedule nutrition and sleep.\n• Polysubstance & mis-sold risks are common in the cathinone market (e.g., α‑PVP or NEP sold as ‘3‑MMC’). Use accredited drug‑checking services where available; start with allergy test doses from any new batch.\n• No human pharmacokinetic data for DMO‑PHP specifically; half‑life is inferred from related α‑PHP/α‑PVP analogs; large inter‑individual variability should be expected.",

    "notes": "• Identity and dose: MEM is rare; mislabeling is plausible. Use reagent testing or, if available, a drug-checking service before ingestion. Weigh doses with a calibrated 0.001 g (milligram) scale and avoid volumetric error. Allergy-test with 1–2 mg on a separate day to screen idiosyncratic reactions. Community and lab-note data support active oral dosing in the tens of milligrams; interindividual sensitivity varies notably. • Onset and redosing: Psychedelic amphetamines can have a slow come-up and very long plateau. Avoid redosing for at least 3 hours; premature redosing can produce an unexpectedly intense and prolonged experience. • Cardiovascular load: Phenethylamine psychedelics may increase heart rate and blood pressure and can cause peripheral vasoconstriction. Those with cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension should avoid use. Seek urgent care if chest pain, severe headache, confusion, or a temperature >39.5°C (103.1°F) develops. • Serotonergic/stimulant interactions: Do not combine with MAOIs (risk of hypertensive crisis or serotonin toxicity). Avoid mixing with tramadol or DXM (both lower seizure threshold/serotonergic), and avoid lithium or tricyclic antidepressants due to reports of life-threatening seizures when such agents are combined with serotonergic psychedelics. • Mental health: Strong psychedelics can precipitate or exacerbate anxiety, panic, psychosis, and mania in vulnerable individuals. People with a personal or family history of psychotic disorders or bipolar disorder should avoid use. • Setting and supervision: Use in a safe environment with a trusted, sober sitter; plan for 16–24 hours without responsibilities, driving, or operating machinery, plus an aftercare window for rest and nutrition. • Hydration/temperature: Maintain normal hydration and temperature; avoid strenuous activity and hot environments to reduce hyperthermia risk during stimulation. • Sleep/recovery: Expect sleep disruption the night after; schedule recovery time. • Frequency/tolerance: Cross-tolerance occurs with other psychedelics. Spacing sessions by at least 1–2 weeks (preferably longer) reduces tolerance build-up and psychological strain. • Unknown toxicology: Human pharmacokinetics and long-term safety are uncharacterized. Conservative dosing and avoidance of poly-drug use are key.",

    "notes": "Identity/purity uncertainty: DPP‑26 is very new to the grey market; vendors have reportedly copied potency claims from dipipanone. Submit samples to a drug‑checking service when possible, and assume unknown potency until lab‑verified. Large variability in active dose has been reported within and between batches. Severe nasal causticity has been described with insufflation; users reported intense burn and irritation. From a harm‑reduction standpoint, avoid IN and especially IV routes; oral is the least risky ROA for uncertain powders. At least one user reported injection burning on a miss and only partial solubility until heating; sterile technique and proper filtration cannot eliminate unknown excipients or caustic pH risks. Compared to methiodone/IC‑26 and dipipanone, several reports describe a quicker onset than methiodone but shorter overall duration (~6–10 h), with prominent sedation and modest euphoria. Redose conservatively and wait at least 3 hours after any meaningful oral dose because peaks can be delayed; stacking increases overdose risk. Co‑use with other depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, GHB/GBL, gabapentinoids) markedly increases the risk of respiratory depression and fatal overdose; avoid these combinations. Potentiation by antihistamines has a history of serious harm: cyclizine can intensify opioid effects and has been linked to dangerous practices with dipipanone mixtures; avoid sedating antihistamines with DPP‑26. Methadone and some opioids can prolong QT; it is unknown if DPP‑26 does, but until pharmacology is characterized, avoid concurrent QT‑prolonging drugs/electrolyte disturbances and seek medical advice if you have cardiac risk factors. Carry naloxone and ensure others know how to use it; sedation can persist into the next day. Expect typical opioid adverse effects: constipation, pruritus, miosis, nausea; mitigate constipation proactively and avoid driving or hazardous work the day of dosing and until completely alert. Immunoassay cross‑reactivity with methadone panels is unknown; given structural similarity to methiodone/dipipanone analogues, a false positive for methadone cannot be excluded; confirmatory testing (GC‑MS/LC‑MS) would be needed.",

Have a trusted sober sitter for first trials. - DOx insufflation significantly increases risk (rapid spikes, nasal injury); oral is the safer route for titration.",

    "notes": "3-FPM is a phenmetrazine analogue; like phenmetrazine it appears to act primarily on dopamine and norepinephrine systems with minimal direct serotonin releasing activity reported, which lowers—but does not eliminate—serotonin syndrome concerns when used alone. However, cardiovascular and neurobehavioral risks typical of stimulants still apply, especially with redosing. Erowid and community reports emphasize strong 'more-ish' qualities and that vaped or insufflated routes are particularly compulsive; pre-planning maximum total dose and avoiding short-interval redoses can reduce harms. Nasal administration is notably caustic and can acutely damage mucosa; if used, finely crush, keep lines small, alternate nostrils, rinse with sterile saline before/after, and allow multi‑day healing intervals to prevent erosions or septal injury. Batch-to-batch variability and adulteration have been reported; where available, use a certified drug checking service and be skeptical of off‑white/pink or gritty material, unexpected residues on heating, or weak effects at typical doses. Combining with alcohol or other stimulants meaningfully increases heart rate, blood pressure, and vasoconstriction; this can raise risks of chest pain, palpitations, and overheating—avoid such mixes and monitor exertion and ambient temperature. Hydration and nutrition matter: sip water regularly (about 250 ml per hour at rest, up to 500 ml per hour if active) and include electrolytes after several hours; eat a balanced meal before use to mitigate appetite suppression and comedown fatigue. Sleep debt strongly worsens anxiety and low mood on the comedown; plan sufficient sleep opportunity, and avoid consecutive‑day use to limit tolerance and compulsion. Pharmacokinetic data for 3‑FPM are sparse; phenmetrazine (the parent drug) has a long half‑life (16–31 h), but 3‑FPM subjectively feels shorter; residual stimulation into the next day can still occur after high or repeated dosing. Given variable market quality, be alert for unexpected effects (e.g., unusual sedation or very long duration) that may indicate mislabeling or cuts; discontinue and consider checking the sample if this occurs. People with hypertension, arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease, or significant anxiety disorders should avoid use or seek medical guidance; stimulants increase cardiac workload and can exacerbate anxiety and bruxism.",

    "notes": "- BZ is an extremely potent, long‑acting muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist intended historically as a military incapacitating agent; “sub‑milligram” amounts can cause days‑long delirium, amnesia, ataxia, and severe disorientation. This is not a recreational drug and exposure should be considered a medical risk scenario.\n- Onset is delayed (commonly 2–4 hours), which strongly increases the temptation to redose; redosing substantially raises the risk of prolonged incapacitation, heat injury, urinary retention, and hospitalization. Avoid any redosing.\n- BZ markedly impairs sweating and heat dissipation (mydriasis, anhidrosis), creating a real risk of hyperthermia even at ambient temperatures; if exposure occurs, remain in a cool environment, remove excess clothing, use passive cooling, and seek medical evaluation for high temperature, agitation, or muscle rigidity.\n- Vision is often severely affected (extreme mydriasis, blurred near focus) for 1–3 days or more—do not drive, cycle, swim, or engage in any hazardous activity until vision and cognition are clearly normal.\n- Hydration is important but should be supervised; anticholinergics can cause both dry mouth and urinary retention. If unable to void for 6–8 hours with suprapubic discomfort, seek urgent care—catheterization may be required.\n- In suspected anticholinergic toxicity, first‑line hospital care is supportive: cooling, IV fluids, electrolyte/CK monitoring, and cautious benzodiazepines for severe agitation. Physostigmine (a tertiary acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) can rapidly reverse delirium in pure anticholinergic toxidrome but must only be administered in a monitored medical setting due to seizure/bradyarrhythmia risk and is contraindicated in TCA co‑ingestion or QRS widening. Do not attempt any antidotes outside a hospital.\n- Combining BZ with other anticholinergics (sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine, TCAs, anticholinergic antipsychotics/antiemetics) markedly increases toxicity (confusion, hyperthermia, ileus, urinary retention). Alcohol, Z‑drugs, and opioids further impair judgement and breathing, compounding injury and aspiration risk. Stimulants may worsen agitation, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis risk.\n- Due to dose variability and idiosyncratic responses, “test dosing” is unsafe here: incapacitating IM doses are on the order of 6–8 µg/kg, and Erowid reports that <1 mg orally can cause profound effects for days.\n- Tolerance data are limited. Military reports describe “second‑dose effects” 2–4 weeks after an initial exposure with faster onset and heightened peaks; repeated exposure increases unpredictability rather than safety. Cross‑tolerance with other antimuscarinics is plausible but unquantified.\n- People with narrow‑angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy/urinary obstruction, ileus, tachyarrhythmias, severe cardiovascular disease, or cognitive disorders, as well as children and older adults, are at elevated risk from anticholinergic toxicity; any suspected exposure warrants professional assessment.\n- Mechanistically, BZ binds with very high affinity in the orthosteric pocket of muscarinic receptors; slow dissociation helps explain prolonged central effects even when plasma levels fall.\n- Legal/forensic note: BZ is listed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (Schedule 2). Civilian availability is rare; unexpected “BZ” representations are often misidentifications of other anticholinergics.\n- If someone seems intoxicated: do not leave them alone; prevent access to heat, water bodies, traffic, or weapons; avoid physical confrontation; call emergency services if there is fever, severe agitation, confusion, chest pain, seizure, inability to urinate, or loss of consciousness.",

    "notes": "HARM REDUCTION RATIONALES (evidence-backed): 1) Identity and potency are often uncertain in the cathinone market and mislabeling is common; pyrrolidinophenones like α‑PVP are frequently found in products sold as other cathinones. Prefer GC/MS drug checking where available; field reagents can only ‘rule in/out’ and cannot confirm identity or purity. Start with a very low test dose. Evidence: Saferparty drug-checking warnings documenting frequent cathinone mislabeling, including α‑PVP substituted for 3‑MMC/4‑MMC; and Erowid’s drug checking guidance stating reagents do not confirm identity. 2) Acute medical risks for substituted cathinones include tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation, seizures, and rhabdomyolysis with potential kidney injury. Avoid physical exertion and hot environments; actively manage temperature (cool environment, rest) and use small, spaced doses. Evidence: clinical/HR review for synthetic cathinones summarizing ED presentations (high neurologic/cardiovascular involvement) and rhabdomyolysis reports. 3) Psychosis and severe anxiety/paranoia are more likely with high doses, frequent redosing, and sleep deprivation. Plan session length, avoid overnight binges, and stop redosing early enough to allow sleep (consider sleep hygiene rather than stacking depressants). Evidence: α‑PVP experience categories on Erowid highlighting ‘Addiction & Habituation’ and ‘Health Problems’; Drugs‑Forum psychosis overview. 4) Compulsive redosing is common with pyrrolidinophenones. Pre-portion doses, lock away the remainder, and set timers (e.g., ≥2–3 h between doses); consider end‑time and a single redose cap. Evidence: numerous α‑PVP user reports describing binges and difficulty stopping. 5) Avoid ‘speedballing’ (stimulants with opioids) and mixing with other stimulants; MAOI combinations are high‑risk (hypertensive crisis). Use TripSit combination guidance for conservative defaults. Evidence: TripSit combination chart guidance and HR materials. 6) Nasal use is often irritating/corrosive; use your own equipment, consider saline rinses afterward, and avoid frequent lines to reduce epistaxis and mucosal damage. Evidence: Saferparty HR advisories for sniffing hygiene. 7) Hydration should be moderate with electrolytes (avoid both dehydration and overhydration). Monitor urine color and body temperature; dark urine, severe muscle pain/rigidity, or confusion warrant urgent medical care. Evidence: cathinone toxicity reviews citing hyperthermia/rhabdomyolysis. 8) Vaping/smoking is reported by some but is associated anecdotally with harsh pulmonary irritation and difficult‑to‑control dosing; avoid inhalational ROAs especially with unknown batch identity. Evidence: Bluelight/Reddit user reports for MDPHP/4F‑PHP noting cough/irritation; no safety data. 9) Use an accurate milligram scale or volumetric solutions; do not eyeball. Evidence: general HR best practice and frequent mislabeling/potency variability documented by drug checking services. 10) Given uncertain serotonergic activity across mislabeled ‘4F‑PHP’ products, be cautious with serotonergic agents (SSRIs/SNRIs, DXM, tramadol) and watch for serotonin toxicity signs even if risk is low with strictly dopaminergic/noradrenergic cathinones. Evidence: cathinone clinical reviews and TripSit combinations. Citations at end.",

    "notes": "Evidence from the EU Early Warning System shows furanylfentanyl has been sold as powders and liquids, including ready‑to‑use nasal sprays and e‑liquids, which can deliver unpredictable doses and increase overdose risk due to concentration errors and non‑uniform mixing. Carry naloxone and be prepared to give repeat doses: synthetic opioids often require redosing every 2–5 minutes and larger total amounts to restore breathing; the aim is ventilation, not full arousal, and medical help should be called immediately. Naloxone will not reverse the effects of non‑opioid adulterants such as xylazine or medetomidine, both of which have been frequently found alongside fentanyl‑class opioids; persistent heavy sedation after naloxone suggests these may be present and requires airway support and monitoring until help arrives. Fentanyl test strips can detect fentanyl and certain analogues at very low levels but are binary only and can give false positives or false negatives depending on sample composition and preparation; follow manufacturer or local drug‑checking instructions and do not assume a negative result means safety. Drug‑checking programs regularly find veterinary tranquilizers (xylazine, medetomidine), benzodiazepine‑related drugs, and multiple high‑potency opioids co‑present in expected fentanyl samples; co‑use greatly increases risk of respiratory depression and prolonged sedation. Because psychoactive doses are in the microgram range, volumetric dosing is strongly preferred over attempting to weigh single doses; use appropriately dilute solutions and labeled containers to reduce dosing error risk. Avoid using alone, avoid rapid redosing during the first 30–45 minutes, and be aware that re‑narcotization can occur after naloxone wears off (30–90 minutes), especially with long‑acting co‑depressants. Ready‑made nasal sprays purchased online or self‑prepared from powders have been seized in Europe; without analytical confirmation, assume concentration may vary bottle‑to‑bottle and within a bottle. Practice basic respiratory first aid during suspected overdose (rescue breaths while awaiting naloxone effect), and continue monitoring due to frequent polydrug contamination in current supplies. Treat any white powder or pressed tablet as potentially containing fentanyl‑class substances; test a small, well‑dissolved sample when possible and start with a sub‑threshold microdose to assess sensitivity.",

Many users report active insufflated doses in the single‑digit to low‑tens of milligrams, indicating very high potency; this makes microgram‑accurate weighing and preferably volumetric dosing essential to avoid accidental overdosing. Supply‑side confusion between tilmetamine and tiletamine has been frequently discussed; at least one set of lab results confirmed high‑purity tilmetamine in two separate samples, yet users still described starkly different effect profiles, so mislabeling cannot alone explain all adverse reactions—expect idiosyncratic responses. Redosing during the same day or on consecutive days is repeatedly associated with markedly worse and longer‑lasting adverse effects (notably whole‑body tremor, fine‑motor impairment, and vestibular disturbances), sometimes lasting days to weeks; avoid binges and space trials by at least several weeks. Several reports describe exacerbation of tremor/anxiety when combined with serotonergic medications (SSRIs, buspirone) or taken while recently on them; given the unknown pharmacology, treat serotonergic co‑use as a risk factor and avoid combinations. People have reported prolonged disequilibrium and vision/focus issues (e.g., delayed accommodation, visual static) that impair driving and fine tasks—do not drive for at least 24–48 hours after moderate–high use and until fully normal. If considering injection routes, be aware that small parenteral doses produced disproportionately strong effects in reports; due to unknown excipients, sterility risks, and the potential for severe neurologic after‑effects, IM/IV use is strongly discouraged outside clinical settings. Use GC/MS‑based drug checking where available to confirm identity and assess purity; reagent kits are of limited value for arylcyclohexylamines and cannot ensure safety. Store in airtight, light‑protected containers with desiccant to limit potential oxidative degradation of sulfur‑containing analogs; avoid heat. In an emergency (severe agitation, psychosis, chest pain, intractable vomiting, or disabling tremor/vertigo), seek medical care; do not attempt to self‑treat with random prescriptions (especially antipsychotics), and disclose that an unknown dissociative may have been used.",

    "notes": "Identity and potency are uncertain in the unregulated market; MDPM has been explicitly marketed as an MDMA substitute on forums, so do not assume contents—use multi-reagent testing and, where available, lab drug checking to confirm identity before any bioassay. Avoid repeating the claim that MDPM is a typical MDMA synthesis impurity; available community evidence points instead to intentional sale as its own product, not a routine MDMA by-product. Onset can be slower than expected for a stimulant (especially orally), which encourages premature redosing—wait at least 90–120 minutes before considering more to avoid accidental overuse. Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, increased blood pressure) is possible; people with uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, or cardiovascular disease should avoid use. Stay cool, take rest breaks, and sip isotonic fluids (avoid both dehydration and overhydration). General stimulant HR supports these measures. Intranasal use can irritate/damage nasal mucosa; if snorting, finely powder, split lines, and use pre/post isotonic saline rinses; consider oral as a lower-harm ROA. Combining with MAOIs, tramadol, or DXM elevates serotonin-toxicity and seizure risks; avoid these combinations entirely. Use extra caution with SSRIs/SNRIs (possible blunting or unpredictable interactions). TripSit’s combo guidance and HR pages support avoiding serotonergic/stimulant risk stacks. Sleep disruption is common; plan ahead, avoid late redoses, and favor non-alcoholic comedown strategies (nutrition, hydration, sleep hygiene; consider OTC sleep aids like melatonin only if appropriate). Pharmacokinetic data in humans are lacking; any in vitro ‘half-life’ figures should not guide dosing. Treat half-life as unknown and dose conservatively, leaving long gaps between sessions. Some users report mild empathic warmth rather than classic MDMA-like entactogenesis; expectations should be set accordingly to reduce risky redosing in search of absent effects. If using regularly, schedule long breaks (weeks) to limit tolerance and dependence; stimulant binges increase risks of psychosis and compulsive redosing as seen with other stimulants. ",

    "notes": "Name/identity: This compound has been sold as “Modafiendz” and discussed as N‑methyl‑4,4'-difluoromodafinil; there is no peer‑reviewed human PK/toxicology, and marketed products may contain variable or mislabelled actives. User reports range from minimal effects to notable palpitations, highlighting batch inconsistency and possible adulteration or degradation. If the analogue shares modafinil’s liabilities, rare but serious cutaneous reactions (e.g., SJS/TEN/DRESS) are a concern; discontinue immediately at any rash or mucosal symptoms. Modafinil‑like CYP effects (3A4 induction; 2C19 inhibition) can meaningfully alter other drugs (e.g., methadone, diazepam) and potentially reduce effectiveness of some hormonal contraceptives—use extra protection while using and for weeks after, pending more data. Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, BP elevation) and anxiety are reported; those with heart disease, arrhythmia history, or panic disorders should avoid or use only with medical oversight. Residual wakefulness can impair sleep architecture for 6–12 h after offset; avoid late dosing and plan sleep hygiene. Avoid combining with other stimulants or high caffeine to limit BP/HR spikes and jitteriness. Do not snort or inject: modafinil‑class compounds are poorly water soluble and not formulated for non‑oral routes; non‑oral use increases harm without added benefit. Due to frequent mislabeling in the unregulated market, consider drug checking where available; basic reagents are not definitive for this class, but MS‑based services can confirm composition. Until human data exist, treat all dosing guidance as provisional and titrate cautiously.",

Community reports consistently describe a narrow comfort window: low–moderate oral doses (≈10–50 mg) feel functional with mild euphoria, while higher/redosed amounts increase anxiety, vasoconstriction, tremor, and sweaty tunnel‑vision. Insufflation is commonly described as harsh on nasal mucosa with a sharper, shorter effect and more peripheral side‑effects; oral is favored for smoother onset. Users frequently remark on sexual arousal/pro‑sociality, compulsive redosing, and insomnia if taken late; repeating 40–60 mg oral doses the same day markedly worsens comedown discomfort. Structural and experiential similarity to pyrrolidine stimulants supports cross‑tolerance with α‑PVP/pyrovalerone‑like agents, though prolintane lacks the β‑keto group and tends to be milder/shorter. HR: identify substances via reagent/lab testing where available; dose accurately with a milligram scale; avoid late‑night redoses; monitor blood pressure/heart rate; maintain fluids and electrolytes; allow multi‑day breaks to reduce tolerance and compulsion; prefer oral route; avoid stimulant stacking and MAOIs; and treat unexpected chest pain, severe headache, or agitation as a medical issue.

    "notes": "Identity: α‑PCYP is a pyrrolidinophenone cathinone; structural identifiers (InChIKey FKEHRWJWTWDTDB) are cataloged by chemistry databases and compendia, confirming nomenclature and class. This backs using class-based harm reduction where substance-specific data are sparse. Route risks: Snorting cathinones is frequently linked to significant nasal and throat irritation and chemical burns; oral routes are typically less damaging to mucosa. Users often report harshness when vaporizing α‑PCYP or similar pyrrolidinophenones. Prefer oral, avoid vaporizing, and if insufflating, use sterile tools and saline care. Compulsive use/psychosis: Cathinones—especially pyrrolidinophenones like α‑PVP—are consistently associated with compulsive redosing, insomnia, paranoia and psychotic episodes. Set strict limits, schedule sleep, and stop at early warning signs (racing thoughts, overheating, suspicious ideation). Cardiovascular strain/overheating: Stimulants raise heart rate and temperature; combining with other stimulants heightens risk. Keep cool, rest periodically, and hydrate modestly (about 250 ml/hour at rest, up to ~500 ml/hour if active). Avoid heavy exertion in hot settings. Drug checking: Mislabeling within the pyrrolidinophenone market is well documented (e.g., α‑PVP sold as 3‑MMC; α‑PiHP sold as 2C‑B). Use accredited drug checking when possible; note FTIR’s ~5% detection limit—trace adulterants may be missed—so single tests can be misleading. Start with very small doses even after testing. Polydrug caution: Alcohol and sedatives can increase risky behavior and mask stimulant intoxication; ‘balancing’ uppers and downers raises overdose/accident risk. If severe agitation, chest pain, or hyperthermia occur, seek medical help; do not self‑treat with more substances. Limited evidence base: Human pharmacokinetics for α‑PCYP are uncharacterized; most info comes from community reports and forensic listings. Treat all dose/duration figures as rough; individual variability is high. ",

MDPV’s duration is short-to-moderate, but residual stimulation and insomnia can persist up to 48 h, and redosing greatly extends both duration and adverse effects. Polydrug use with MAOIs can precipitate hypertensive crises due to catecholamine excess; avoid completely. Combining with other stimulants markedly elevates cardiovascular and psychosis risks. Depressant combinations (alcohol, opioids) raise crash/overdose and heart-strain risks; if a benzodiazepine is used to manage overstimulation, avoid any other depressants and use the minimum effective amount. Psychosis, hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis have been documented in severe intoxication and binges; rapid cooling, fluids and medical care are critical warning thresholds. Injection and inhalation have been linked to severe toxicity and at least one fatality; these routes also strongly increase compulsive redosing—avoid. Misrepresentation in the market is common across cathinones; drug checking can detect substitutions (e.g., MDPPP sold as 3‑MMC); start low and wait at least 2 h before redosing if oral. Immunoassay urine screens may cross‑react (false‑positive PCP has been reported); confirmatory testing (GC/MS) resolves this. Nasal harm reduction: use clean, personal equipment; alternate nostrils; rinse with saline afterward to reduce tissue damage.",

    "notes": "Evidence-based harm-reduction additions and corrections (reasoning and citations below): 1) Dosage correction: PIHKAL associates 2C‑N with much higher oral doses than originally listed. Community bioassays report noticeable to fully psychedelic effects at ~100–130 mg (HCl salt), with 60 mg nitrate described as mild. The prior 8–30 mg range risks underdosing and confusing 2C‑N with far more potent NBOMe analogs; corrected to 90–130 mg common range with conservative lower bands. 2) Salt-form potency: One Erowid report explicitly notes the nitrate salt is ~9% less potent than HCl; while anecdotal, users should account for salt mass when weighing. 3) Short duration: Reports consistently describe a shorter total timeline (≈3–5 hours at typical doses), so duration was tightened to 3–6 hours with rapid onset at higher doses. 4) Interaction specifics: TripSit’s combination guidance for 2C‑x supports listing MAOIs as ‘dangerous’, tramadol as ‘unsafe’ (seizure risk), and stimulants/caffeine as cautionary due to cardiovascular and anxiety load; SSRIs/SNRIs may attenuate or unpredictably alter effects. 5) Insufflation caution: Across 2C‑x, insufflation is commonly very painful with greater side effects; oral dosing is strongly preferred for safety and comfort. 6) Misidentification risk: 2C‑N is rare; NBOMes/NBOHs on blotter or as potent sub‑mg powders are sometimes sold as ‘2C‑x’. NBOMes are active at microgram doses and have been linked to medical emergencies; always test and avoid unknown blotters as ‘2C‑N’. 7) Legal risk (U.S.): 2C‑N was added to Schedule I in July 2012, creating substantial legal penalties for possession/distribution. 8) Tolerance: Classic 5‑HT2A psychedelics rapidly produce tolerance within days with cross‑tolerance across LSD/psilocybin/mescaline/DOx; spacing uses by ~10–14 days reduces unpredictable responses. 9) Phenethylamine body load: Some users report mild GI upset, stimulation, or vasoconstriction; avoid combining with vasoconstrictive stimulants and monitor hydration and temperature. 10) Data scarcity: Human data are limited; individual variability is high; start low, weigh accurately, and prefer oral administration.",

    "notes": "• The majority of catastrophic harms reported with “krokodil” are linked to impure, highly acidic home‑cooked mixtures containing iodine, red phosphorus by‑products, phosphoramides, and other corrosives; these contaminants—not pharmaceutical desomorphine itself—drive tissue necrosis, phlebitis, osteomyelitis, and systemic infections. Laboratory and clinical reviews consistently attribute the extreme local damage to these by‑products. Keep expectations realistic: harm reduction cannot fully mitigate risks from unknown, caustic mixtures.\n• If injecting any opioid, markedly reduce risk by using sterile water, new sterile equipment each time, and a 0.22 μm wheel filter (PVDF/nylon) to remove particulates and many bacteria; avoid using cotton/cigarette filters. Avoid IM/SQ (“muscling/skin‑popping”), which carries especially high risk of abscess and necrosis with contaminated solutions. Rotate sites; never share supplies. These steps are standard HR practice and particularly critical with suspected krokodil.\n• Rapid onset with short duration increases redose compulsion; plan doses in advance, avoid stacking, and use milligram‑accurate scales. Test allergy sensitivity with a very small fraction of an intended dose if opioid‑naïve or uncertain potency. Community and historical medical sources describe substantially higher potency than morphine by IV, underscoring overdose risk at mg/sub‑mg errors.\n• Overdose risks: profound respiratory depression may peak early and can outlast perceived euphoria. Do not use alone; have naloxone present and someone trained to respond (rescue breathing, emergency services). Be aware of renarcotization: naloxone works 30–90 min; effects may wear off while the opioid persists—monitor for recurrence and repeat dosing as needed.\n• Adulteration alert: opioid supplies in many cities frequently contain benzos (e.g., bromazolam), xylazine, and multiple high‑potency opioids (fluorofentanyl, nitazenes). These combinations blunt naloxone’s effect on sedation (xylazine) and increase overdose severity. Utilize drug‑checking services where available; if using test strips, remember fentanyl strips do not detect xylazine/benzos.\n• Prefer non‑injecting ROAs (e.g., oral) when possible; if injecting, aim for near‑neutral pH and fully dissolved, filtered solutions; never inject turbid/colored mixtures. Seek prompt wound care for redness, swelling, warmth, severe pain, fever, or streaking—these are infection warning signs.\n• Tolerance escalates rapidly with frequent dosing; physical dependence can develop within days. Plan spacing and consider opioid agonist therapy if daily use emerges. Keep constipation prevention in mind (hydration, fiber/osmotic laxatives) and avoid driving/operating machinery during and after use due to prolonged sedation.\n• Supply reality: genuine, pharmaceutical‑grade desomorphine (e.g., historic Permonid) is almost never encountered; most “krokodil” reports involve crude, variable products with desomorphine sometimes only a minor component. Dose assumptions are therefore highly unreliable. ",

The come-up can be slow (often 60\u2013120 min) with a wave-like rise; premature redosing in the first 2\u20133 hours markedly increases risk of over-intoxication, nausea, and cardiovascular strain. 5\u2011APB is commonly encountered as the HCl or succinate salt; by weight, HCl contains more active base than succinate\u2014doses should be reduced if the material is HCl or unusually pure. Reagent behavior can resemble MDMA on some tests (e.g., Marquis/Mecke dark reactions), so use a panel (e.g., Froehde, Simon\u2019s) rather than a single reagent and avoid assuming MDMA results confirm MDMA. As a serotonergic entactogen with stimulant properties, 5\u2011APB should not be combined with MAOIs, DXM, tramadol, triptans, or serotonergic supplements (5\u2011HTP) due to serotonin toxicity risk; combining with other stimulants amplifies hypertension, hyperthermia, and arrhythmia risk. Benzofurans show concerning 5\u2011HT2B activity in vitro discussions; although clinical data are limited, frequent use may pose a theoretical valvulopathy risk\u2014pace use (e.g., several weeks between sessions) and avoid if you have heart disease. Manage environment and temperature: take breaks from heat, sip water regularly, and include electrolytes on long sessions; avoid heavy alcohol (dehydration, masking warning signs). Common adverse effects include jaw clenching, nausea/vomiting on come-up, headaches during/after, insomnia, and transient anxiety\u2014dose control, cool ambient temperature, and avoiding redose can mitigate these. Insufflation is irritating and may increase intensity but reduce duration; oral administration is generally preferred for smoother effects. Cross-tolerance with MDMA/MDA and similar entactogens is reported; spacing uses reduces \u201cmuted\u201d effects and post-acute low mood. Because benzo fury-era products were often adulterated, be cautious with pressed pellets or unusually colored powders, and titrate with an accurate milligram scale after reagent testing.",
