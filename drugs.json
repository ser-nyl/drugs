    "notes": "25I‑NBOMe is an ultra‑potent 5‑HT2A agonist active at microgram doses; the difference between a strong and dangerous dose can be small, particularly with nasal use or concentrated liquids. Numerous severe toxicities and fatalities have been reported, especially from misidentified blotters and insufflated powders. Reagent testing is essential when a blotter is sold as “LSD”: Ehrlich/Hofmann positive and a lack of rapid, vivid Marquis color change support lysergamide; NBOMes generally show no Ehrlich/Hofmann reaction and often give pronounced Marquis reactions on paper. Taste is not diagnostic, but a strong bitter/metallic taste with oral numbness is commonly reported for NBOMes; treat as a warning and test. Never eyeball powder; prepare measured solutions (volumetric dosing) and label concentrations clearly to avoid accidental overdoses. Because oral (swallowed) bioavailability is unreliable, sublingual/buccal absorption is the typical route; hold for 15–30 minutes before spitting/swallowing. Significant vasoconstriction (cold/numb extremities, cramps, hypertension) and agitation can occur; avoid stimulants, strenuous activity, overheating, and stay hydrated with small sips. In an emergency (seizure, hyperthermia, severe agitation, chest pain, uncontrolled hypertension), seek immediate medical help; clinicians typically use benzodiazepines and supportive care. NBOMes have frequently been laid on blotters resembling LSD; do not assume any blotter is LSD without testing. Strong cross‑tolerance exists with classical psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DOx, 2C‑x), and redosing within days will be less effective yet may increase side‑effects. Legal status: controlled in many jurisdictions (e.g., EU control recommended 2014; US Schedule I since 2016).",

    "notes": "3‑MeO‑PCP is active in the single‑milligram range; inaccurate scales can lead to large relative dosing errors, so volumetric dosing is strongly recommended. The dose–response curve is steep and onset can be delayed, making premature redosing a common cause of accidental over-intoxication. It is an NMDA receptor antagonist and has been described by TripSit as also exhibiting mild serotonin reuptake inhibition, so combinations with serotonergic substances warrant extra caution. Compared with ketamine, it can produce clearer stimulation but is also more likely to induce ambulatory delirium, disinhibition, and manic or psychotic states at strong doses. Erowid documents that at least one death has been associated with 3‑MeO‑PCP and warns of episodes where users cannot distinguish fantasy from reality, increasing risk of harm in uncontrolled environments. Avoid mixing with alcohol or benzodiazepines due to unpredictable sedation and accident risk; avoid driving or hazardous activities until the next day because after‑effects can persist up to 48 hours. People with a personal or family history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or mania should avoid due to elevated risk of psychiatric destabilization. The RC market is prone to mislabeling and variable purity; reagent testing and conservative allergy tests reduce risk. Tolerance builds rapidly with frequent use; spacing sessions by multiple weeks reduces both tolerance and compulsive redosing patterns.",

    "notes": "Rationale for additions (harm reduction): Para-halogenated amphetamines such as p-chloroamphetamine are used as serotonergic neurotoxins in animal research; community moderators and chemistry-focused users warn that 4-BA is analogous and likely neurotoxic, so conservative guidance treats it as a high-risk agent with poor recreational value; therefore, the safest advice is avoidance or, failing that, very cautious titration with no redosing. Reagent kits are not sufficient to characterize 4-BA; if a sample is suspected, submit to a mass-spectrometry drug checking service where available; these services publish ongoing findings and are designed to help people make safer choices. Mixing with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM, triptans, methylene blue, or other serotonergic agents can precipitate dangerously elevated serotonin and autonomic instability; TripSit’s combinations guidance supports avoiding serotonergic-stimulant + antidepressant/MAOI stacks. Even plain amphetamines raise heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature; overheating and dehydration increase risk with any stimulant, so active cooling, spacing doses, and electrolyte-containing fluids are advised; TripSit’s amphetamine factsheets (e.g., Adderall/Vyvanse) emphasize tachycardia, hypertension, dehydration, and hyperthermia risks. Intranasal use can spike plasma levels and may increase neurotoxic and cardiovascular stress relative to cautious oral dosing; oral-only is the least risky ROA if someone does not abstain. This general ROA principle is reflected across harm-reduction communities and TripSit resources. Because validated human pharmacokinetics are lacking, any stated duration and dosing should be treated as uncertain; community posts about 4-BA focus on neurotoxicity and advise against use rather than providing reliable dosing, reinforcing that there is no ‘established’ safe dose. Cardiac strain and vasoconstriction concerns suggest those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or on QT-prolonging/pressors should avoid entirely; stimulant HR pages highlight these effects for amphetamines generally. Post-acute low mood, anxiety, and sleep disruption are plausible due to serotonergic and catecholaminergic depletion; community warnings specifically mention prolonged 5-hydroxyindole depletion after exposure to para-halogenated amphetamines. If a vendor is offering 4-BA/4-CMA, community advisories recommend warning others and not stocking/using; some vendors have been called out for listing such neurotoxins recently, increasing the risk of mis-selling into stimulant markets.

    "notes": "4-HO-MET is a 4-hydroxylated tryptamine analogous to psilocin; community and Shulgin/TiHKAL notes place oral activity around 10–20 mg with 4–6 h total duration, but sensitivity varies widely—always titrate from low doses with an accurate milligram scale or volumetric dosing. Research chemicals are frequently misrepresented; use drug checking: Ehrlich reagent should turn positive for indoles but only confirms an indole, not identity—use multiple reagents (e.g., Hofmann/Marquis/Mecke) and prefer lab testing when available. Most retail 4-HO-MET is the fumarate salt due to better stability; keep airtight, dry, opaque, and cold (freezer with desiccant) to slow oxidation/darkening; color change does not reliably indicate potency loss, but degradation is possible over time. Avoid vaporizing/smoking salts; 4-substituted tryptamines tend to thermally degrade and give unreliable effects; oral is most characterized and predictable. Insufflation has a faster onset and shorter duration but is irritating and moreish; nasal care (saline rinse) helps, and redosing is often less efficient due to rapid tachyphylaxis. Dangerous interactions include MAOIs (potentiate/instability), lithium (documented seizures with serotonergic psychedelics), and tramadol (seizure and serotonin toxicity risk); avoid triptans near dosing windows for added serotonergic/vasoconstrictive risk. SSRIs/SNRIs commonly blunt psychedelic effects and make dose-response unpredictable; do not increase dose to compensate without caution. Combining with stimulants or empathogens can markedly increase cardiovascular load and anxiety; if combining at all, use lower doses than usual and cool environments. Cannabis can strongly amplify visuals and anxiety on 4-HO-MET; introduce late and gently if at all. Keep a calm, trusted sitter for first trials; if severe anxiety/overstimulation occurs, a measured benzodiazepine dose can de-escalate but impairs memory/coordination—avoid alcohol and other depressants concurrently. Tolerance to serotonergic psychedelics rises rapidly after a session and decays over about 7–14 days; cross-tolerance occurs with LSD/psilocybin/other tryptamines—spacing sessions reduces dose creep and preserves psychological integration.",

    "notes": "5‑MeO‑DMT is extremely potent and fast‑acting; vapourized breakthrough effects can occur from as little as 3–5 mg in some users, so pre-measuring on a 0.001 g scale and avoiding “eyeballing” is critical for safety. Acute, short-lived non‑responsiveness and loss of motor control are frequently reported above ~8–10 mg smoked/vaporized or ~15–20 mg insufflated; a sober sitter and a clear, padded space reduce injury risk during the 3–10 minute peak. Combining 5‑MeO‑DMT with MAO inhibitors (harmala alkaloids or pharmaceutical MAOIs) greatly elevates systemic 5‑MeO‑DMT and bufotenine exposure and has been implicated in severe toxicity; avoid this combination entirely. Serotonergic medications and agents (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs, MDMA, tramadol, DXM, linezolid, 5‑HTP) can raise the risk of serotonin syndrome; spacing and medical advice are prudent if prescribed such drugs. Depressants like alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines add sedation and aspiration risk during peak non‑responsiveness; at least one fatality following insufflation involved concurrent heavy alcohol use. Nasal use is better suited to salt forms (HCl/fumarate); freebase burns and absorbs poorly, and onset is slower with a more extended after‑period. Oral 5‑MeO‑DMT is generally inactive without MAO‑A inhibition; because MAOIs substantially increase risk, oral/“pharmahuasca” approaches with 5‑MeO‑DMT are not recommended. “Bufo”/toad secretion contains additional, variably present compounds and has inconsistent potency; synthetic 5‑MeO‑DMT permits accurate dosing and avoids wildlife/ethical harms. Start with the lowest end of dose ranges, use a temperature‑controlled vaporization method (avoid direct flame charring), and pre‑arrange recovery position guidance with a sitter in case of vomiting. Individuals with cardiovascular disease, seizure history, or unstable psychiatric conditions should avoid use; prolonged anxiety or destabilization can occur in some users and may require integration support. Expect rapid tolerance within a session; redosing during the peak typically produces diminished or dysphoric effects, and spacing sessions by at least several days is prudent.",

    "notes": "Reasoning and evidence for each harm‑reduction addition:\n- Legal/scheduling and non‑approval: DrugBank lists Acetorphine as Experimental/Illicit and not approved; isomerdesign’s compiled schedules list it as US CSA Schedule I, UK Class A, and Canada Schedule I. This means any human possession or use carries severe legal risk and there is no medical dosing guidance.\n- Extreme potency by class and absence of human dosing: Acetorphine is an oripavine/morphinan derivative closely related to etorphine; there are no validated human dosing data on DrugBank or PubChem. Treat as ultra‑potent; any attempt to extrapolate from veterinary practice is unsafe.\n- Depressant combination risks: Authoritative harm‑reduction tables emphasize that opioids combined with benzodiazepines or GHB/GBL are dangerous due to synergistic respiratory depression; large observational datasets also show higher severity for benzo+opioid ED visits. These interactions are therefore listed as Dangerous.\n- Gabapentinoids with opioids: Systematic evidence synthesized on NCBI Bookshelf shows increased overdose mortality and hospital/ED utilization when gabapentin or pregabalin are co‑prescribed with opioids; hence marked as Caution.\n- MAOIs and certain opioids: TripSit’s interaction guidance and supporting literature flag rare but severe reactions (excitatory and depressive) when opioids are combined with MAOIs; avoid.\n- Tramadol with other opioids: TripSit cites elevated seizure risk and additive respiratory depression; listed as Unsafe.\n- Overdose response: Community guidelines on opioid overdose care emphasize airway support and naloxone administration, with re‑dosing/monitoring due to naloxone’s shorter action versus many opioids. For ultra‑potent opioids, anticipate multiple naloxone doses and prioritize ventilation until definitive care.\n- Duration: No human PK/PD data are available on DrugBank; field experience is veterinary and not transferable to humans; we avoid numeric claims.\n- Category correction: Acetorphine is an opioid; it is not a dissociative. DrugBank classifies it structurally as a morphinan; dissociatives act primarily via NMDA antagonism, which is not applicable here.\nOperational harm‑reduction guidance:\n- Do not attempt any human dosing or self‑experimentation. There is no safe dose window established and fatal toxicity can occur at extremely low exposures compared with common opioids.\n- Never combine with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, Z‑drugs, GHB/GBL); these combinations are over‑represented in severe ED outcomes.\n- If any exposure is suspected: call emergency services immediately, provide rescue breathing if needed, and administer naloxone promptly; repeat doses may be required. Monitor for renarcotization.\n- Gabapentinoids and first‑generation antihistamines substantially increase sedation and respiratory depression; avoid co‑use.\n- Avoid MAOIs and tramadol with any potent opioid due to seizure and atypical reactions.\n- Legal risk is high across jurisdictions (US/UK/CA scheduling as a narcotic).

    "notes": "Apomorphine is a fast-acting non‑ergoline dopamine agonist used as a rescue for 'off' episodes in advanced Parkinson’s disease; it has no opioid effects despite its name. 5‑HT3 antiemetics such as ondansetron or granisetron are contraindicated with apomorphine because the combination has produced profound hypotension and loss of consciousness; do not use these for nausea prophylaxis with apomorphine. In regions where available, domperidone (peripheral D2 antagonist) is often used for 72 hours before initiating apomorphine to reduce nausea and hypotension; in the US, trimethobenzamide has historically been used instead—avoid 5‑HT3 agents for this purpose. Initial test dosing and titration should occur under medical supervision because orthostatic hypotension, syncope, or severe emesis can occur during early titration. Sublingual and subcutaneous routes have rapid onsets (about 10–20 minutes) and short durations; sublingual film half‑life is longer than IV, which can extend effects. Daytime somnolence and sudden sleep attacks have been reported with dopamine agonists; avoid driving/operating machinery until you know your response. Alcohol and other CNS depressants can increase dizziness, sedation, and fall risk, especially during dose escalation. Antipsychotics that block D2 receptors can blunt apomorphine’s benefit and exacerbate parkinsonism; coordinate care if such agents are necessary. Injection-site rotation and proper subcutaneous technique reduce local reactions when using pens or pumps; infusion is reserved for frequent, prolonged 'off' periods under specialist care. Kynmobi sublingual film (10–30 mg) was marketed 2020–2023 in the US and then discontinued for commercial reasons; subcutaneous products and infusion systems remain available in many regions. Always verify cardiovascular status (including orthostatic blood pressures) during initiation and when adjusting doses.",

    "notes": "Clonazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine; mean elimination half-life is ~30–40 hours, so effects and impairment can persist into the next day and accumulate with repeated dosing. Combining benzodiazepines with opioids and/or alcohol greatly increases the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression; avoid co-use and be extra cautious if there is any chance opioids are involved. If opioids may be present, naloxone reverses the opioid component but not clonazepam; always call emergency services and place the person in the recovery position if breathing is slow/shallow or they are unresponsive. Flumazenil (benzodiazepine antidote) should not be used outside medical care because it can precipitate seizures in benzodiazepine-dependent users or mixed overdoses. Clonazepam’s metabolism involves hepatic CYP3A4; strong inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolides, cimetidine) may raise levels and sedation, while enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) may lower them; dose stacking to compensate is risky. Due to poor water solubility (<0.1 mg/mL) and tablet binders, non-oral routes (e.g., injection) are unsafe and can cause serious tissue harm; stick to oral use as intended. Expect pronounced anterograde amnesia at higher doses; avoid important decisions, cooking, or risky activities, and do not drive or operate machinery for at least a full waking day after moderate-to-strong doses. Paradoxical agitation/disinhibition can occur, especially with alcohol or in susceptible individuals; if agitation appears, do not redose benzodiazepines or add alcohol—seek a calm environment and supportive monitoring. Counterfeit ‘benzo’ tablets are common; only use pharmacy-dispensed clonazepam or have unknown tablets checked by a competent drug-checking service when available. For non-medical contexts, minimize frequency (e.g., spacing uses by weeks), avoid daily use, and do not escalate doses to chase effects; tolerance and dependence can develop quickly. People with respiratory disease, sleep apnea, liver impairment, or older adults are more sensitive to sedation and respiratory depression; lower doses and extra caution are warranted.",

    "notes": "Rationale: Edgewood/NRC analyses identify EA-3167 as one of the longest-lasting anticholinergic incapacitating glycolates, with incapacitation lasting roughly 4–10 days and peak delirium within the first 1–3 days; this extreme duration creates unusually high risks of dehydration, hyperthermia, wandering/accidents, and inability to self‑care. Rationale: Two accidental high-dose exposures to EA‑3167 described in NRC review showed mild but noticeable cognitive impairment persisting for approximately six months before full recovery, underscoring the potential for protracted neurocognitive after‑effects following severe intoxication. Rationale: Standard toxicology guidance for anticholinergic syndrome supports aggressive supportive care (cooling, IV fluids, urinary retention management) and careful use of IV benzodiazepines for agitation; physostigmine is indicated for severe, confirmed anticholinergic delirium but requires cardiac monitoring and repeat dosing due to short action. Avoid physostigmine in mixed/unknown overdoses (e.g., TCA co‑ingestion). Rationale: Additive anticholinergic burden with first‑generation antihistamines, tricyclics, and phenothiazines can worsen delirium, tachycardia, and arrhythmia risk; several carry QT‑prolongation liabilities. Rationale: Combining with alcohol, opioids, or unsupervised benzodiazepines increases sedation/blackout and aspiration/trauma risk during delirium; clinical benzodiazepine use differs because it is titrated IV with monitoring in emergency settings. Rationale: Onset to incapacitation around 1–2 h and long distribution into CNS imply that delayed care seeking is common; having sober supervision and rapid access to emergency services is essential if exposure is suspected. Rationale: Because effects outlast likely plasma kinetics, serum levels are a poor guide to clinical severity; treatment is guided by toxidrome. Rationale: Due to extreme hazard profile, non‑medical use is effectively non‑existent; information is presented solely to prevent harm in accidental or historical exposure contexts. ",

    "notes": "- Street heroin varies widely in purity and is frequently adulterated. Laboratory drug checking has repeatedly found heroin samples containing fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, 4‑ANPP precursors, caffeine/lidocaine cuts, and xylazine; these substantially increase overdose and morbidity risks. Always treat unknown powder as potentially fentanyl‑positive and use fentanyl test strips when feasible. Note that fentanyl strips do not detect nitazenes.\n- Xylazine (a veterinary sedative) may be present with heroin/fentanyl (“tranq”). Naloxone should still be given during overdose because it reverses the opioid component, but it does not reverse xylazine’s sedative effects; expect prolonged sedation and provide rescue breathing.\n- Do not mix with other depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, GHB, barbiturates, Z‑drugs). This combination is a leading pattern in fatal opioid poisonings due to additive respiratory depression.\n- Gabapentinoids (pregabalin/gabapentin) significantly elevate overdose risk, especially with opioids; multiple EU countries report rising fatalities with pregabalin involvement. Avoid this combination.\n- Tolerance drops quickly after even short breaks; resuming a previous dose after abstinence is a common cause of fatal overdose. Start far lower after any lapse.\n- If injecting, base heroin (No.3) must be acidified with citric or ascorbic acid to dissolve; always use sterile water, new equipment, and avoid sharing to prevent infections (HIV, HBV/HCV, SSTIs). Rotate sites and use the finest appropriate needle and filtration possible.\n- Smoked/insufflated routes generally have a slower onset and slightly lower overdose risk than IV; however, polydrug use still drives most severe outcomes. Use with a trusted person present and have naloxone on hand.\n- Naloxone saves lives: carry it, train peers, and expect that multiple doses may be required if fentanyl/nitazenes are involved. Take‑home naloxone (THN) programmes are expanding across Europe; pharmacy access is widespread in the US. Continue rescue breathing while awaiting EMS.\n- EUDA notes diamorphine crosses the BBB within ~20 s after injection and has a plasma half‑life of ~3 minutes; much of the clinical effect comes from rapid formation of 6‑MAM and morphine. Oral ingestion is comparatively ineffective. These kinetics explain rapid onset (“rush”), short parent half‑life, and multi‑hour effects.\n- Terminology warning: “China white” is now often used for non‑heroin synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl analogues). Never assume composition from street names; rely on testing and conservative dosing. ",

    "notes": "Most hydrocodone IR products are co‑formulated with acetaminophen (APAP); keep total APAP from all sources ≤ 4,000 mg in 24 h (lower in hepatic disease or chronic alcohol use) to reduce risk of severe liver injury. Dose‑dumping and fatal overdose can occur if extended‑release hydrocodone (e.g., Hysingla ER, Zohydro ER) is crushed, chewed, or dissolved—swallow whole only. Respiratory depression risk is highest during initiation, after dose increases, or when combined with other CNS depressants; avoid mixing with alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z‑drugs, barbiturates, or GHB/GBL. Hydrocodone is metabolized by CYP2D6 to hydromorphone (active) and by CYP3A4 to norhydrocodone (inactive); strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including ritonavir in Paxlovid) can dangerously raise hydrocodone levels, while inducers can reduce analgesia and precipitate withdrawal; CYP2D6 inhibitors can blunt hydromorphone formation and alter response. Combination with serotonergic drugs (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, some muscle relaxants, tramadol) has produced serotonin‑toxicity cases; monitor or avoid high‑risk combinations. Counterfeit opioid tablets adulterated with potent synthetic opioids (e.g., nitazenes/fentanils) have been reported in Europe; avoid non‑pharmacy pills and consider carrying naloxone; do not use alone. Opioid‑naïve individuals and those with reduced tolerance after a break are at particularly high overdose risk—start low, go slow, and space doses ≥ 4–6 h. Common adverse effects include sedation, miosis, pruritus, nausea, and constipation; maintain bowel regimen (hydration, fiber, stimulant + stool softener as needed). Avoid driving or hazardous tasks while sedated; impairment can persist beyond subjective effects. Seek urgent care for severe drowsiness, slowed or irregular breathing, cyanosis, or unresponsiveness; naloxone is the first‑line reversal for life‑threatening respiratory depression.",

Supply is often misrepresented: pressed “mescaline pills” and microdots are almost never true mescaline and are frequently LSD/DOx/2C-x/MDxx—use reagent testing and, when possible, a lab drug-checking service. Dose by weight with a calibrated mg scale and know the salt form (HCl vs sulfate/citrate) before comparing numbers. Combining with MAOIs (irreversible) or lithium has a poor safety record and should be avoided; RIMAs markedly potentiate and alter character and nausea. Set, setting, and sitter matter: plan 12–16+ hours of downtime, hydrate, avoid heat stress, and have a calm space prepared. Tolerance to classic psychedelics develops quickly and crosses between mescaline, LSD, and psilocin; spacing sessions by 1–2+ weeks helps restore sensitivity. Avoid driving, swimming, or hazardous activities until fully baseline the next day. For severe anxiety or dysphoria, reduce stimulation (lights/sounds), breathe slowly, change environment, and seek support; medical management may involve benzodiazepines but that should be clinician-guided.",

    "notes": "- Purity/formulation matter: street meth is almost always the hydrochloride (HCl) salt, which is water-soluble and directly smokable; meth freebase is an oily liquid and uncommon. Do not attempt to base or re-base street crystals; this creates caustic products and adds risks. Salt-to-base potency differs by ~20% (HCl MW ~185.7 vs base 149.2).\n- Half-life and duration vary with urine pH: alkalinization markedly slows renal clearance and can extend both duration and adverse effects; acidification speeds clearance. Intentionally altering body pH to tweak duration is risky and discouraged.\n- Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmia, chest pain) and hyperthermia are leading acute harms; risk escalates with dose, redosing, dehydration, heat, and polydrug stimulant use. Seek urgent care for chest pain, severe headache, or high fever.\n- Neurotoxicity risk increases with high doses, hyperthermia, and prolonged wakefulness; spacing sessions, sleeping, eating, and keeping cool are protective behaviors.\n- Redosing drives binges and insomnia. Plan a cutoff time; dose early in the day; avoid stacking routes (e.g., smoking then IV).\n- Hydration: sip ~250–500 mL/h of water or oral rehydration solution when active/hot; avoid overhydration. Replace electrolytes on long sessions.\n- Oral care: dry mouth (xerostomia) and bruxism increase caries risk. Prefer water over sugary sodas; use sugar-free gum/lozenges for saliva; brush gently before bed; consider fluoride rinse.\n- Insufflation: rotate nostrils; use fine powder; rinse with sterile saline after to reduce irritation and septal damage.\n- Smoking: use heat-control (no direct flame on crystal), avoid sharing pipes/mouthpieces to reduce infection transmission from burns/sores; allow glass to cool to prevent cracks and cuts.\n- Injection: use new sterile equipment every time; filter with a 0.22 μm wheel filter if possible; avoid ‘acidifying’ crystal HCl; rotate sites; never share equipment; watch for signs of infection or endocarditis (fever, chills, new heart murmur).\n- Drug checking: if available, use reagent testing or mail-in lab services. Fentanyl test strips can detect contamination but require high dilution to avoid false positives from concentrated stimulants; test every new batch and carry naloxone where contamination is prevalent.\n- Medicines/supplements: CYP2D6 inhibition (e.g., some antidepressants) can increase active levels; combining with serotonergic or seizure-threshold–lowering drugs (e.g., tramadol) increases risks.\n- Legal status: Schedule II (US) for limited medical uses; illicit supply varies in purity and may include adulterants; never assume any batch is pure.",

Early signs include gait disturbance, hypophonia, and falls; MRI classically shows T1 hyperintensity of the globus pallidus. Redosing pressure is high due to the short duration; spacing doses and setting a firm session cap reduces binge risk and sleep deprivation. Like other stimulants, methcathinone can acutely raise heart rate and blood pressure; those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or arrhythmia risk should avoid use and everyone should avoid strenuous exertion while under the influence. Combining with MAOIs is hazardous (hypertensive crises, hyperthermia) and should be strictly avoided; combining with tramadol or bupropion increases seizure risk. Mixing with alcohol increases dehydration and cardiostress while masking intoxication; with benzodiazepines, sedation can mask stimulant overuse and encourage redosing — treat as a caution-only combination reserved for managing severe agitation. Insufflation is irritating/caustic; use tiny test lines, rotate nostrils, rinse with saline after, and allow mucosa to recover between sessions. Use a precise milligram scale, lab‑verified material when possible, and consider reagent testing/drug checking to rule out substitutions or manganese contamination. Expect a comedown (anxiety, dysphoria, insomnia); nutrition, hydration, and planning sleep ahead of time reduce harm. Frequent use builds tolerance rapidly and can drive dose escalation; spacing sessions (≥1–2 weeks) reduces risk of dependency and persistent mood changes.",

    "notes": "- Co-administration with alcohol can potentiate CNS effects and has been specifically warned to cause 'dose-dumping' with some extended-release formulations (e.g., OROS), rapidly releasing large doses and increasing adverse-event risk; avoid alcohol around dosing, particularly with ER products.\n- Manipulating ER/OROS tablets (crushing, chewing, splitting, perforating) defeats controlled-release, causing unpredictable spikes; use only as designed.\n- MAOI use within 14 days is contraindicated due to severe hypertensive and hyperadrenergic reactions; do not combine.\n- Stimulants including MPH can raise heart rate and blood pressure and have rarely been associated with serious cardiovascular events (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction, sudden death), especially in those with structural heart disease; screening for cardiac risk factors is prudent and non-medical high-dose use increases risk.\n- Insufflating IR tablets increases local harm from binders/fillers (irritation, epistaxis, mucosal injury) and encourages compulsive redosing; community HR sources explicitly advise against snorting due to excipients.\n- Injecting crushed tablets is high-risk: insoluble excipients (e.g., talc) can embolize causing 'Ritalin lung' (panlobular/panacinar emphysema/talcosis) and severe, sometimes irreversible pulmonary damage; IV use also carries blood-borne infection risks.\n- Combining MPH with other pro-convulsant medicines (e.g., bupropion) or with very high stimulant doses can lower seizure threshold; caution and dose minimization reduce risk.\n- Dosing late in the day and redosing in short intervals increases insomnia risk and next-day fatigue; spacing doses and setting a last-dose cutoff helps mitigate this.\n- Oral IR dosing has slower onset and longer total duration than insufflation, which hits faster but wears off quicker; users often report stronger comedown and rebound with faster routes.\n- Alcohol plus stimulants can mask alcohol intoxication and increase cardiovascular strain; even beyond dose-dumping, this pairing raises risk behaviors and toxicity; safer to avoid co-use.\n- Tolerance to subjective euphoria and focus can build quickly with frequent use; spacing use days and avoiding binges reduces tolerance and crash severity (anecdotal but consistent across user communities).\n- If breastfeeding, available data for the active isomer (dexmethylphenidate) suggest low milk levels and low infant exposure; however, non-medical use and high doses are inappropriate during lactation.\n- Extended-release brand systems differ (e.g., OROS vs multi-layer beads), producing different time–concentration curves; switching products can change onset/peak even at the same milligram strength.

    "notes": "Mirogabalin is an α2δ subunit modulator of voltage‑gated calcium channels, not a GABA(A) agonist; expect sedative and ataxic effects from reduced excitatory neurotransmission rather than direct GABAergic action. Combining with opioids or other CNS depressants substantially increases overdose risk due to additive respiratory depression; this pattern has been implicated in European mortality monitoring for gabapentinoids as a class. If an opioid is present during an overdose, naloxone reverses the opioid but not mirogabalin—continued monitoring and supportive breathing are still required. Like other gabapentinoids, abrupt discontinuation after sustained use can precipitate withdrawal (anxiety, insomnia, tremor, nausea; rarely seizures); taper gradually under medical supervision. Dose accumulation occurs in renal impairment—start lower and extend intervals; older adults are more susceptible to dizziness, confusion, and falls. Avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least 6–8 hours after dosing (longer with higher doses or combinations). Peripheral edema and weight gain can occur in this class; monitor if you have cardiovascular or edema‑prone conditions. To reduce harm: use single‑substance sessions, avoid redosing loops, keep hydrated but not excessive, and never mix with alcohol/benzos/“Z‑drugs”. If using around opioids, ensure ready access to naloxone and do not use alone. Store securely to prevent diversion.",

    "notes": "Oxazepam is a 3‑hydroxy benzodiazepine and the active metabolite of diazepam and temazepam; unlike many benzodiazepines it undergoes direct glucuronidation (UGT2B15/UGT2B7/UGT1A9) to an inactive metabolite, so it has fewer CYP‑mediated interactions and is often preferred in hepatic impairment, though sedation/fall risk still applies. The mean elimination half‑life is about 8.2 hours (reported range roughly 4–21 h); onset is slow and variable with a typical Tmax around 3 hours, so avoid redosing for at least several hours to minimize cumulative CNS depression. Combining oxazepam with other depressants—particularly alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, or barbiturates—markedly increases risks of respiratory depression, aspiration, overdose, and death; if an opioid is taken accidentally together, seek medical help and place the person in the recovery position. Co-use with gabapentinoids and sedating antihistamines also heightens sedation and overdose risk; avoid or drastically reduce doses if such combinations cannot be avoided. Do not drive or operate machinery after dosing; psychomotor and cognitive impairment can persist into the next day, especially with higher or repeated doses. In patients with sleep apnea or significant respiratory disease, benzodiazepines can worsen hypoventilation and are generally not recommended. Paradoxical agitation, disinhibition, or irritability can occur—stop use and seek medical guidance if these appear. Abrupt discontinuation after regular use can precipitate benzodiazepine withdrawal (rebound anxiety, insomnia, tremor, and, in severe cases, seizures); taper gradually under medical supervision. Pregnancy and breastfeeding: benzodiazepines cross the placenta and appear in breastmilk; neonatal flaccidity, withdrawal, and respiratory depression are reported—avoid unless clearly indicated by a clinician. In older adults, even therapeutic doses are associated with increased risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and possible long‑term dementia associations; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. Because oxazepam’s absorption is slow and its lipophilicity relatively low, non-oral ROAs provide no safety advantage and may increase harms; stick to oral use as prescribed. Consider dose equivalence cautiously when switching: a rough guide is ~20 mg oxazepam ≈ 10 mg diazepam, but individual responses vary—always reduce and re-titrate when converting.",

Label dosing devices (scoops) are unreliable; a scale is recommended.\n• Avoid dosing late in the day; users commonly report insomnia or sleep disruption when taken in the afternoon or evening.\n• Combining with choline donors can reduce racetam‑associated headaches in some but may also increase stimulation, anxiety, or headaches if choline load is excessive; adjust choline slowly if used.\n• Concurrent use with CNS depressants (opioids, benzodiazepines, sedatives) can increase CNS depression risk per DrugBank’s interaction listings; avoid or use only under medical oversight.\n• Limit stacking with other stimulants (e.g., high caffeine, modafinil) to reduce risk of tachycardia, anxiety, and insomnia; space compounds and test combinations cautiously. General stimulant HR principles apply.\n• Some reports suggest racetams can potentiate MDMA’s acute effects and alter the comedown; given uncertainty and interindividual variability, avoid this combination or proceed only with strong experience and conservative dosing.\n• Pharmacokinetic human data are limited in open sources; treat use in renal impairment, pregnancy, or breastfeeding as higher risk and consider avoidance or medical guidance due to uncertain elimination and lack of safety data. DrugBank lists Oxiracetam as investigational with sparse PK fields.\n• Take with food and adequate hydration to mitigate nausea or GI discomfort reported anecdotally.\n• Do not rely on subjective clarity to judge fitness to drive or operate machinery; stimulant-like effects can mask impairment or cause over‑arousal.

    "notes": "• Combining oxycodone with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, gabapentinoids, GHB) greatly magnifies risks of overdose, respiratory depression, and death; this is a leading driver of fatalities. TripSit and clinical reviews flag opioid+benzo/gaba combos as dangerous; gabapentinoid co-prescription doubles opioid-related mortality in observational data. • CYP3A4 strongly affects oxycodone exposure. Adding an inhibitor (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolides, protease inhibitors, grapefruit) after you’re stable on a dose can acutely raise oxycodone levels and cause overdose; starting/stopping inducers (rifampin/carbamazepine/phenytoin/St. John’s wort) can lower levels or, when stopped, rebound them upward. This warning appears in the oxycodone label summaries (MedGen/NCBI) and DrugBank metabolism section. • CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, some SSRIs/SNRIs) reduce formation of oxymorphone and can change effect profile (sometimes less analgesia but more parent-drug sedation). Use extra caution if adding/stopping these. Label summaries note enhanced effects when 3A4 and 2D6 inhibitors are combined. • Counterfeit “oxycodone/Percocet” tablets are common; drug-checking projects repeatedly find fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, nitazenes (e.g., metonitazene, protonitazepyne), and benzodiazepines (e.g., bromazolam) instead of oxycodone. Use fentanyl test strips, but know they do not detect nitazenes; many onsite FTIR devices also miss <5% content. Laboratory checking where available is safer. • Keep naloxone (or nalmefene) accessible and teach people around you to use it. Naloxone reverses opioid respiratory depression; multiple doses may be required with potent adulterants. Community distribution programs show thousands of overdose reversals. • If you only have acetaminophen-containing products (e.g., Percocet), track total daily APAP from all sources and stay ≤4,000 mg/day to avoid liver injury. Consider a properly performed cold-water extraction (CWE) to reduce APAP before non-medical use; never rely on CWE to make unsafe doses “safe.” • Prefer oral dosing. Avoid injecting or smoking crushed tablets: insoluble binders and tamper-resistant matrices raise risks of emboli and serious tissue/organ harm; TripSit explicitly flags IV use of oxycodone tablets as extremely dangerous. • Do not chew/crush ER products (e.g., OxyContin) for non-medical use: this can release the full dose at once (“dose dumping”) and sharply increase overdose risk. Redose cautiously and leave several hours between doses because sedation/respiratory depression can outlast euphoria. Label summaries and clinical texts warn about this. • When using alone is unavoidable, use tiny test doses, avoid mixing depressants, and arrange a check-in or use an overdose-detection line; know basic rescue breathing. If someone is unresponsive, call emergency services, give naloxone, and provide rescue breathing until help arrives. • Chronic use: constipation is near-universal; hydrate, use fiber/osmotic laxatives as needed. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia can occur; increasing doses may paradoxically worsen pain—seek medical review. • Driving/operating machinery is unsafe while affected. People with sleep apnea, COPD, or on sedatives are at higher risk of nocturnal hypoventilation—start at low doses and avoid co-depressants.",

    "notes": "Phenobarbital is a long-acting barbiturate used primarily as an anticonvulsant; it enhances GABAA-mediated inhibition and also dampens excitatory transmission, producing dose-dependent CNS and respiratory depression. Its elimination half-life averages roughly 79 hours (range ~53–118 h), which means effects can accumulate across days; redosing on the same day or consecutive days markedly increases overdose risk. As a strong inducer of multiple CYP isoenzymes, phenobarbital reduces the efficacy of many medications, notably combined oral contraceptives (risk of unintended pregnancy) and warfarin (risk of subtherapeutic anticoagulation), and can lower levels of other antiepileptics; users should avoid assuming familiar medications behave normally while on phenobarbital. Barbiturates carry a narrow therapeutic index: toxic and even fatal blood concentrations overlap with or lie not far above therapeutic levels, making self-titration hazardous; overdose deaths typically result from respiratory depression compounded by hypotension and coma. Combining with other CNS depressants (opioids, alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, GHB/GBL, sedating antihistamines, carisoprodol) substantially increases the risk of fatal respiratory depression; this risk persists for days because phenobarbital remains in the body long after the subjective effects fade. Phenobarbital is contraindicated in acute or latent porphyria and should be avoided in significant hepatic impairment; it can precipitate porphyric crises via enzyme induction. Chronic use can cause dependence; abrupt cessation after sustained daily use can provoke severe, potentially life-threatening withdrawal (including seizures)—any stop should be medically supervised and slowly tapered. Avoid driving or tasks requiring alertness for at least 24 hours after dosing (longer with higher or repeated doses), as coordination and reaction time are impaired even when one feels “sober.” If phenobarbital has been used with opioids, naloxone reverses only the opioid component—sedation from phenobarbital may persist and requires airway support and monitoring by professionals. Parenteral phenobarbital must be administered by clinicians; nonmedical IV use (especially of tablet formulations) risks immediate apnea/hypotension and catastrophic local injury; intra-arterial and subcutaneous injection are explicitly unsafe. Use in pregnancy is associated with congenital risks; avoid nonmedical exposure during pregnancy and lactation.",

    },
    "notes": "Piracetam is almost entirely renally excreted unchanged; dose accumulation is possible in renal impairment and the drug is dialyzable, so individuals with reduced kidney function should consult a clinician and consider dose reduction. It exhibits antiplatelet and hemorheologic effects (e.g., reduced platelet aggregation; lower fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor levels), so caution is warranted with concurrent anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and around surgeries or active bleeding conditions. Oral bioavailability is near 100% with Tmax around 1 hour (CSF ~5 h), and steady state in about 3 days; acute ‘stimulant-like’ effects are usually mild, with many benefits reported only after several days of regular dosing. Common side effects include nervousness, insomnia, agitation, and headache; taking doses earlier in the day and splitting the total daily amount may reduce sleep disruption. Some users report racetam-associated headaches that improve with ensuring adequate dietary choline or adding a choline source; this is anecdotal and excessive choline can cause GI upset. Clinical use spans cognitive disorders, vertigo, cortical myoclonus, dyslexia, and sickle cell disease, but evidence quality varies by indication and it is not FDA-approved in the United States. High therapeutic doses (e.g., up to 24 g/day) are used for cortical myoclonus under medical supervision; such dosing outside clinical oversight increases the likelihood of adverse effects (e.g., insomnia, agitation) without proven added benefit in healthy users. Piracetam crosses the placenta; safety in pregnancy and lactation is not established—avoid unless prescribed. Because piracetam products are often purchased online in some regions, product quality can vary; use reputable sources and be cautious of mislabeling—general drug checking practices improve safety even when the risk of adulteration is perceived to be low. Do not substitute piracetam for established treatments (e.g., for epilepsy or cognitive disorders) without clinician guidance; rodent data suggest complex interactions with antiepileptics, but clinical anticonvulsant efficacy is limited. Start low, assess individual sensitivity over several days, and avoid combining with strong stimulants until individual effects are known. ",

    "notes": "Standard anaesthetic practice uses continuous infusions of 0.05–0.25 µg kg⁻¹ min⁻¹; analgesia ceases within ~5 min of pump stoppage due to ester hydrolysis. Context-sensitive half-life is ~3–4 min regardless of infusion length. Bolus dosing outside monitored settings is strongly discouraged because apnoea or chest wall rigidity can occur before the syringe is empty. Chest/truncal rigidity with potent opioids is more likely with rapid IV pushes; slow administration and airway support are essential in clinical settings. Metabolism is by nonspecific blood/tissue esterases to an inactive acid; CYP inhibitors are not expected to prolong effect. Remifentanil can produce acute tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, especially after higher doses or abrupt cessation of infusions; expect rebound pain/craving within minutes once stopped. In overdose, prioritize airway/ventilation; give naloxone in small, titrated IV boluses (e.g., 0.04 mg) to restore breathing while minimizing severe withdrawal, and be prepared for re-sedation if longer-acting opioids or other depressants are present. Non-medical IV use carries high risks of hypoxia, infection, and BBVs; if people use regardless, sterile technique, low-dead-space syringes, never using alone, and access to naloxone/overdose response training reduce but do not eliminate risk.",

    "notes": "Key harm-reduction points and rationale: SDX is an orally activated prodrug with low oral bioavailability (~3%) and slow enzymatic conversion; this design aims to reduce rapid spikes in d-MPH and lowers intranasal/IV reinforcement—non-oral misuse is unlikely to enhance effects and may increase harm from excipients. DrugBank PK data support the slow conversion and low SDX bioavailability; intranasal/IV misuse deterrence is an inference consistent with the prodrug model. Cardiovascular screening is important: CNS stimulants can increase BP/HR and, rarely, cause serious events (stroke, MI, sudden death) in predisposed patients; assess personal/family cardiac history and consider baseline vitals before use. Peripheral vasculopathy (e.g., Raynaud’s) is reported with stimulants; keep warm, avoid nicotine, and seek evaluation if finger/toe color changes occur. Stimulants may precipitate or exacerbate psychosis or mania; avoid if unstable psychosis/bipolar and monitor for new hallucinations or mood elevation. Priapism (painful prolonged erections) is a rare but notable risk with methylphenidate-class stimulants; urgent care is required if >4 hours. Co-use with alcohol can increase d-MPH exposure and form ethylphenidate, adding cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity risk; avoid mixing. For sleep, take early in the morning; food does not meaningfully change overall exposure but delays Tmax, which can shift the effect curve later into the day. Appetite and weight loss can occur; maintain nutrition and hydration and consider timing meals around the dose. In youth, chronic stimulant therapy may affect growth trajectories; periodic height/weight checks are recommended (clinical context). Avoid stacking multiple stimulants (including decongestants/energy products) and space dosing to prevent redosing escalations; plan off-days if clinically appropriate to limit tolerance. Never crush/snort/inject contents; beyond low expected efficacy due to prodrug design, excipients and beads can damage tissues or cause emboli if injected. Store securely to prevent diversion and accidental pediatric exposure. Evidence sources: DrugBank serdexmethylphenidate/dexmethylphenidate monographs for PK, cardiovascular/psychiatric warnings, food effects, and metabolism (including ethylphenidate formation); TripSit and community HR resources for general stimulant-mixing cautions; some route-of-abuse deterrence specifics are inferred from the prodrug pharmacology and supported anecdotally by user reports.",

Maintain a 14‑day washout when switching to or from serotonergic antidepressants; extend to 5 weeks after fluoxetine due to its long half-life. Hypertensive crisis (“cheese reaction”) can occur from dietary tyramine or sympathomimetic drugs; earliest sign is often a severe occipital headache, and can progress to chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, confusion, and seizures — seek emergency care immediately. Serotonin syndrome risk is high if combined with serotonergic medicines (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs, clomipramine, MDMA, tramadol, DXM, linezolid, methylene blue); symptoms include agitation, hyperreflexia, clonus, fever, diaphoresis, diarrhea — urgent evaluation is required. Avoid OTC cold/cough products that contain dextromethorphan or decongestants (pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine); many carry a label warning against use within 14 days of an MAOI. Follow a low‑tyramine diet throughout therapy and for 2 weeks after stopping; avoid aged cheeses, cured/fermented meats, soy sauce/miso/yeast extracts, fava beans, and tap/draft beers; packaged spirits in modest amounts still require caution for hypotension/CNS effects. For planned surgery or dental procedures, inform anesthesia providers; some agents (e.g., meperidine, serotonergic antiemetics) are contraindicated, and perioperative plans may need adjustment. Tranylcypromine has a stimulant-like profile and can cause insomnia and orthostatic hypotension; dosing earlier in the day and dividing doses may reduce insomnia and BP swings. Rare hepatotoxicity has been reported; baseline and periodic liver function and blood pressure monitoring are prudent in clinical use. Carry an MAOI alert card/bracelet listing key contraindications (meperidine, DXM, serotonergic antidepressants, sympathomimetics) so emergency staff can avoid dangerous drugs.",

    "notes": "Trazodone is a SARI that at low doses primarily blocks 5‑HT2A/H1/alpha‑1 receptors and is sedating, while at higher antidepressant doses it also meaningfully inhibits the serotonin transporter; this dose‑dependent pharmacology explains why 25–100 mg often helps sleep but does not treat depression without daytime dosing. It should be taken after food when possible to lessen lightheadedness and orthostatic hypotension, a common early adverse effect due to alpha‑1 blockade. Clinically important risks include QT prolongation and rare torsades de pointes; combinations with other QT‑prolonging agents or in patients with cardiac disease/electrolyte derangements warrant extra caution and consideration of ECG monitoring. Priapism is a rare but serious emergency; an erection lasting more than 4 hours or painful erections require immediate ER evaluation; risk may be higher early in treatment and in those with hematologic diseases (e.g., sickle cell) or penile anatomic variants. CNS depression is additive with alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z‑drugs, opioids, and gabapentinoids; combining increases risk of respiratory depression, impaired driving, and falls—avoid or minimize and use the lowest effective doses with planned timing. Serotonin syndrome can occur when combined with MAOIs, linezolid, IV methylene blue, or other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, tramadol, triptans, dextromethorphan, fentanyl, St John’s Wort); observe a 14‑day washout from MAOIs and monitor for agitation, tremor/clonus, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (clarithromycin, azole antifungals, ritonavir) and grapefruit juice can raise trazodone exposure—leading to more sedation, hypotension, and arrhythmia risk—while CYP3A4 inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St John’s Wort) can reduce efficacy. Older adults are more susceptible to hyponatremia/SIADH and orthostatic hypotension; check sodium if confusion, headache, seizures, or falls occur, and consider dose reductions. Hepatic metabolism is primary and rare idiosyncratic liver injury has been reported; obtain baseline LFTs and recheck if clinically indicated or if symptoms (e.g., jaundice, dark urine, pruritus) develop. There are reports of increased INR with warfarin and increased digoxin levels; monitor especially after initiation or dose changes. Screen for bipolar spectrum illness before starting because antidepressant‑induced switching or mania has been reported; discontinue if mania emerges. Avoid driving, cycling, operating machinery, or engaging in safety‑critical tasks until you know your next‑day alertness; next‑morning impairment is more likely with higher doses, interactions, sleep deprivation, or when combined with other depressants. Discontinuation should be gradual to reduce rebound insomnia and withdrawal‑like symptoms (nausea, dysphoria, agitation, paresthesias).",

    "notes": "Do not combine alprazolam with opioids, alcohol, or other sedatives; this combination greatly increases the risk of respiratory depression, coma, and death. A boxed warning applies to the class for opioid co‑use. Alprazolam is primarily metabolized by CYP3A; strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, fluvoxamine) and grapefruit can raise levels markedly; strong inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort) can lower levels and precipitate withdrawal or loss of effect. Street “Xanax” bars are frequently misrepresented; drug‑checking services have repeatedly found potent designer benzodiazepines (e.g., flualprazolam, norflurazepam) or other unexpected actives in tablets sold as alprazolam. Use professional drug checking where available and avoid assuming imprint/appearance equals identity. Do not stop suddenly after repeated dosing; benzodiazepine withdrawal can include seizures and delirium. Tapering should be gradual and medically supervised; flumazenil can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent users and is generally avoided outside specific monitored indications. Alprazolam impairs attention, memory, and coordination; avoid driving or hazardous tasks while affected and after high or interacting doses. Avoid non‑oral routes: crushing tablets for injection/insufflation introduces fillers that can damage tissue and vasculature, and increases risk without added safety. Rapid onset and short/moderate duration encourage redosing and can accelerate tolerance; spacing use and conservative dosing reduce risk.",

    "notes": "GBL is a prodrug rapidly converted to GHB in vivo; relative to GHB it is more potent by volume and has a faster, sharper onset, which increases overdose risk from small mismeasurements. GBL is a skin/mucosal irritant solvent; always dilute in a non‑alcoholic drink before swallowing, avoid contact with eyes/skin, and never inject or insufflate. The dose‑response curve is steep: recreational doses lie close to doses causing unrousable sleep and, at higher levels or when mixed with other depressants, life‑threatening respiratory depression. Redosing too soon causes stacking: wait at least 2 hours between doses and reduce any redose; dopamine‑rebound wakefulness 3–5 hours later can create a strong compulsion to redose but increases risk of dependence. Food reduces/slow s absorption; many HR groups suggest dosing at least 2 hours after eating and avoiding further redose until effects fully plateau. Never combine with alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, barbiturates, Z‑drugs, or other depressants; ketamine with G markedly increases loss of consciousness and breathing problems. If someone becomes unrousable, place them in the recovery position, keep airway clear, monitor breathing, and seek emergency help; do not ‘wake’ them with stimulants or give more substances. Tolerance can develop in days with frequent use; withdrawal may begin within 1–6 hours after the last dose and can escalate to agitation, delirium, tachycardia, and life‑threatening complications — medical supervision is essential for dependent users. Concentration varies by source and bottles; unknown dilution is common — start low (0.3–0.5 mL), measure precisely to 0.1 mL, and label doses/times to avoid mistakes. GHB/GBL may reduce efficacy of some HIV medications; avoid co‑use and consult a clinician if on antiretrovirals. As a solvent, GBL can degrade some plastics; prefer glass (or chemically resistant equipment) for storage/measurement, clearly label, add a food‑safe dye to avoid accidental ingestion, and keep locked away from children/pets. Do not drive or operate machinery; some HR groups advise waiting at least 24 hours after last dose before driving due to residual impairment and stacking.",

    "notes": "• OTC combination products are a major hazard at recreational doses: many syrups/pills include acetaminophen (liver toxicity above therapeutic limits), first-generation antihistamines (anticholinergic delirium, seizure risk), or decongestants (cardiovascular strain). Choose single-ingredient DXM-only products if one insists on use. • DXM effects and safety vary strongly with CYP2D6 genotype and with inhibitors: poor metabolizers or those on potent 2D6 inhibitors can experience unusually long, dysphoric, or toxic effects from doses others tolerate; always test with a low dose and avoid redosing if metabolism is unknown. • Serotonin syndrome is the key life-threatening interaction (triad of autonomic instability, neuromuscular hyperactivity, and altered mental status). Avoid combining DXM with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, tramadol, MDMA, 5-HTP, or St. John’s wort. • Extended-release polistirex (Delsym) is often perceived as ‘half as strong, twice as long’: onset is slower, peaks are broader, and impairment lasts much longer—harder to manage in uncontrolled settings; plan extra recovery time and avoid redosing. • Redosing to ‘stack plateaus’ increases the risk of the so‑called Plateau Sigma pattern (days-long delirium/psychosis-like states); most accounts rate it as extremely unpleasant and risky—avoid intentional Sigma pursuit. • Ataxia and nystagmus (‘robo-walk’) increase fall/accident risk; do not drive or do hazardous activities. Use in a safe, calm setting with a sober sitter at higher plateaus. • Frequent use rapidly builds tolerance and worsens after-effects; spacing uses by multiple weeks reduces cumulative harm. • Chronic heavy DXM HBr use can add significant bromide load; rare cases of bromism present with neuropsychiatric symptoms and spurious hyperchloremia—seek medical care if prolonged confusion/neurologic symptoms occur. • DXM can produce false-positive immunoassay urine screens for PCP (and occasionally other classes); confirmatory GC/MS usually resolves this. Carry medication info if testing is expected. • Avoid products branded Coricidin HBP (‘Triple C’) and other multi-ingredient tablets widely linked to adverse events; the non-DXM actives drive much of the toxicity.",

    "notes": "Identity and purity in the current supply are uncertain; drug checking is strongly advised because mislabeling and unexpected contents in powders/crystals are common in unregulated markets. Start with a low single dose, wait at least 2 hours before considering any redose, and avoid stacking multiple redoses to reduce cardiac and insomnia risks. As with methylphenidate analogs, expect dose‑dependent increases in heart rate, blood pressure, anxiety, jaw tension, and appetite suppression; those with cardiovascular or anxiety disorders should exercise heightened caution. Intranasal use can damage nasal mucosa over time; divide lines finely, use each nostril sparingly, rinse with saline after sessions, and avoid sharing equipment to reduce infection risk. Avoid injecting; if someone is intent on IV use, sterile technique, allergy testing with a tiny fraction dose, and filtration are essential to reduce acute harms from insoluble binders or contaminants. Combining with MAOIs is hazardous due to hypertensive events; avoid this combination entirely. Tramadol plus stimulants can lower seizure threshold and increase serotonin toxicity risk; avoid co‑use and space by many half‑lives if medically required. Stimulant comedowns can be mitigated with sleep hygiene, fluids, electrolytes, gentle nutrition, and time; avoid chasing sleep with high‑dose alcohol or benzodiazepines due to masking/overdose risk. Because potency appears lower than methylphenidate for many, there is a temptation to escalate doses; use a calibrated milligram scale, consider volumetric solutions for accurate micro‑titration, and cap the session length before starting. Insomnia is common after late‑day dosing; avoid use within 8–12 hours of planned sleep. Cross‑tolerance with other phenidates is likely; leave sufficient spacing (several days or longer) between sessions to reduce tolerance and binge‑cycle risk. Little formal human pharmacokinetic/toxicology data exists for 4‑Me‑TMP; absence of data is not evidence of safety—use conservative dosing and vigilant self‑monitoring.",

Discontinue and seek medical care if jaundice, right‑upper‑quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, or marked fatigue occur. • Consider baseline and periodic liver function tests (ALT/AST/bilirubin) if using beyond single occasional trials or more than once weekly; avoid if you have known liver disease. • Avoid stacking with hepatotoxins (heavy alcohol, high/repeated acetaminophen, anabolic steroids, isoniazid, high‑dose vitamin A) during the same week of use. • Onset can be variable; some users report very delayed or stepwise onsets and sudden intensity several hours later. Because of this, do not redose for several hours after an initial dose. • Cardiovascular screening and monitoring similar to other stimulants is prudent: avoid if you have uncontrolled hypertension, significant heart disease, or hyperthyroidism; check blood pressure/heart rate during first trials. • MAOIs are contraindicated with sympathomimetic stimulants due to hypertensive crises—do not combine within 14 days of MAOI use. • Combining with other stimulants or high caffeine increases risks of anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, bruxism, and insomnia; spacing such agents is safer. • Subjective effects are often described as functional stimulation with focus and minimal euphoria; however, some users experience marked anxiety, body load, and dysphoria at doses others find moderate—start low, titrate cautiously. • Prefer oral administration; insufflation appears in anecdotes but offers no safety advantage and may increase adverse effects. • Product authenticity/purity is uncertain in gray markets; reagent references for cyclazodone are sparse. Where possible, use professional GC/MS drug checking; otherwise, avoid multi‑gram purchases and unknown vendors. • Tolerance to stimulation builds with frequent use; spacing use by several days reduces tolerance and cumulative strain on the liver and sleep. • There is no established human half‑life; effects are long enough that late‑day dosing can impair sleep. • Do not combine with decongestants (pseudoephedrine/phenylephrine) or other adrenergics due to additive pressor effects. • Avoid during pregnancy or if trying to conceive; there are no human safety data.",

    "notes": "Identity and data scarcity: CFPP is an obscure halogenated phenylpiperazine with essentially no published human pharmacology; most available information comes from class‑level summaries and older community reports about phenylpiperazines (mCPP, TFMPP, pFPP). Mislabeling/adulteration with piperazines has historically been common in ‘ecstasy’ markets; laboratory drug checking is strongly advised over reagent‑only testing. Reports from mCPP/TFMPP users consistently mention dysphoria, anxiety/panic, nausea, headaches/migraines, thermoregulation changes and a multi‑day ‘hangover’; CFPP likely shares a similar adverse‑effect profile by structural analogy. Serotonergic toxicity can occur when combined with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM, triptans, lithium or other serotonergics—avoid these combinations and seek urgent care if symptoms of serotonin syndrome (agitation, hyperreflexia/clonus, sweating, fever) appear. Phenylpiperazines tend to be more ‘body‑loady’ than euphoric; start with an allergy test (≈1–2 mg), use oral dosing rather than insufflation to reduce local irritation and headache, and avoid redosing—users report that redoses often deepen adverse effects without improving mood. Cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, hypertension) are part of this class; keep cool, take measured breaks from dancing/exertion, sip fluids modestly, and avoid both over‑ and under‑hydration. Because CFPP’s metabolism and half‑life are unknown, allow the full duration plus at least several hours before considering any additional substances. If severe anxiety, tremor or overheating develops, prioritize cooling, rest and consider a benzodiazepine in standard therapeutic doses if not contraindicated; seek medical help for high fever, confusion, chest pain, or persistent vomiting.",

Avoid redosing early; wait at least 2–3 hours before considering more to reduce blackout risk. • Like other benzodiazepines, pyrazolam can cause anterograde amnesia, impaired coordination, and “functionality illusions” (feeling calm while motor skills and judgment are impaired). Do not drive or perform safety-critical tasks. • Combining with other depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, Z‑drugs) greatly increases overdose risk via additive respiratory depression; harm-reduction groups flag benzo–opioid combos as a key driver of poisonings. • Dependence and difficult withdrawal (including seizures) are documented across the new/illicit benzodiazepines category; avoid frequent use and do not stop abruptly after extended use—seek medical guidance for tapering. • Given the variability and mislabeling in this market, volumetric dosing (dissolving a known quantity into a measured volume and dosing by volume) can reduce dose error; TripSit provides a calculator and guidance. • Some community reports claim pyrazolam dissolves readily in water; others note pH-dependent solubility similar to midazolam. Treat solubility claims cautiously; if making solutions, use appropriate solvents/containers and label clearly to prevent accidental ingestion. • Designer/illicit benzodiazepines are sometimes found in opioid samples (“benzo-dope”); if using opioids, assume possible benzo co-exposure and carry naloxone—but note naloxone does not reverse benzodiazepines. • Legal status varies and can change quickly. In the UK and many EU countries, new benzodiazepines including pyrazolam have been targeted by controls; possession/supply may be illegal. • Amnestic effects increase steeply with dose and with combinations; users report blackouts at higher doses or with stacked redoses—consider a trusted sober sitter if experimenting.

Insufflation produces a faster, sharper onset and is commonly described as painful/irritating; oral use is easier to titrate. Product stability varies: exposure to heat, moisture, and oxygen can darken material over time (often towards tan/brown) and partial hydrolysis to psilocin may occur; potency may drift and batches may co‑contain psilocin—test and start low with new supplies. Salt form differences (fumarate vs HCl) change mass‑by‑mass potency only modestly; Erowid’s chemistry notes suggest the typical fumarate is diprotic, making the practical potency gap just a few percent rather than ~25% as sometimes claimed. Community drug‑checking data and reports have found some samples containing both 4‑AcO‑DMT and psilocin, consistent with hydrolysis or co‑formulation. Store airtight, dry, and cold (freezer, desiccant, light‑protected) to slow degradation; avoid long‑term aqueous solutions. Test with Ehrlich’s (indole positive but non‑specific); reagent testing cannot reliably confirm identity—lab analysis is required. Avoid use if you or close family have psychotic or bipolar spectrum disorders; psychedelics can precipitate mania/psychosis in susceptible individuals. Use a sitter, sober environment, and avoid driving for the rest of the day. Because delayed onsets (up to ~2 h) are occasionally reported, do not redose early.",

No authoritative human pharmacology, dose, or impairment data were found in standard HR sources; therefore any self-experimentation should follow microdosing principles, single-variable changes, and long observation intervals. ‘Alt-cannabinoid’ markets have a track record of mislabeling and adulteration (including semi-synthetic cannabinoids and acetate derivatives), which increases risk when buying products labeled as CBL; seek recent full-panel certificates of analysis (COAs) covering potency, residual solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, microbials, and list of diluents. Inhalation risks are elevated for oils and cartridges that may contain non-cannabinoid thickeners; vitamin E acetate adulteration was linked to EVALI cases in 2019, underscoring the need to avoid unknown cutting agents. For those subject to drug testing, note that routine immunoassays target THC metabolites (THC-COOH); full-spectrum hemp/cannabis products marketed as ‘CBL’ can still trigger positives if they contain THC. Because subjective and objective effects are undefined, avoid driving or safety-sensitive tasks until you know your individual response and the product’s true contents.",

    "notes": "Potent NPS stimulant of the pyrrolidinophenone family closely related to α‑PVP/α‑PHP; typically appears as white/off‑white powder or crystals. Batch potency varies widely across vendors and time—use a 0.001 g scale, allergy test (≈1 mg), and incremental titration. Vaporization has the fastest onset and the highest redose liability; many users report compulsive re‑hitting leading to binges, sleep loss, and anxiety spikes. Insufflation is commonly described as notably caustic to nasal mucosa, with increasing irritation and nosebleeds across a session; post‑use saline rinses and spacing lines reduce harm. Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, hypertension), vasoconstriction (cold extremities), hyperthermia with exertion, and severe insomnia are the most common acute risks; avoid heat, hydrate with electrolytes, and rest. If anxious or paranoid, reduce stimulation, cool down, and consider non‑sedating de‑escalation first; if a benzodiazepine is used, avoid redoses and combining with other depressants due to blackout/respiratory risk. Set a pre‑commitment: cap session total and stop‑time to disrupt redosing loops—many binges escalate after the first hour. Adulteration/misrepresentation occurs in street pills/powders; use reagent tests and, where possible, submit samples to a lab‑based drug checking service. Extended binges increase risk of psychosis‑like symptoms; sleep, nutrition, and at least several days of abstinence are protective. Data on human pharmacokinetics is sparse; avoid frequent reuse within the same week to limit tolerance and sleep debt.",

Forum meta-reports consistently place its potency in the sub‑milligram range, with ~0.25 mg often compared to a typical anxiolytic dose range of diazepam; avoid any pressed tablets claiming multi‑milligram doses. Onset is notably slow for a triazolobenzodiazepine (often 1–2 h, sometimes 3 h), which greatly increases redosing risk and blackout potential. Volumetric dosing is essential: dissolve a known amount in a measured volume (e.g., 1 mg in 10–20 mL ethanol/propylene glycol), mix thoroughly, and measure doses with an oral syringe; do not eyeball powders or shave tablets. Wait a full 3–4 hours before considering any redose due to delayed peak and amnesia. Multiple reports describe next‑day impairment lasting well beyond the perceived high; avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least 24 h after dosing. Novel benzodiazepines are widely found in counterfeit ‘Xanax/Valium’-type tablets and in non‑benzo samples; mislabeling and extreme dose variability have been repeatedly documented by drug‑checking and early warning systems — treat unknown tablets/solutions as suspect and test where possible. Combining with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, dissociatives, or gabapentinoids is the main cause of life‑threatening events; treat these as hard contraindications. Naloxone reverses opioids but not benzodiazepines; always prioritize airway and breathing in mixed‑drug poisonings until help arrives. Flumazenil can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent users and should only be given in a clinical setting by trained staff. Because supply may include bromazolam or other benzos mis‑sold as clobromazolam, assume mislabeling until proven otherwise and start at the absolute minimum dose.",

This makes potency, duration, and interaction risks less predictable; drug checking is strongly advised before setting doses. Reports consistently describe rapid onset, short-to-moderate dissociation, and a tendency toward stimulation or restlessness compared with ketamine, which can encourage redosing; pre‑measuring doses and setting a session limit can reduce escalation. Like other arylcyclohexylamines, heavy or frequent use may contribute to ketamine‑type cystitis/uro‑toxicity (urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain); spacing sessions by weeks, staying within conservative doses, and seeking care if urinary symptoms appear are prudent. Combining with CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB) markedly increases blackout, aspiration, and respiratory depression risk; if someone becomes unresponsive, place in the recovery position and seek help. Stimulant combinations increase tachycardia, agitation, and manic states; avoid if possible or keep doses very low with sober monitoring. Because many “FXE” samples are actually 2F‑2′‑oxo‑PCE, and some batches show atypical effects, treat reagent color changes and appearance as non‑diagnostic; only lab‑grade analysis (FTIR/GC‑MS/LC‑MS) can confirm identity. Nasal use can irritate mucosa; use fine powders, alternate nostrils, and rinse with saline post‑session to reduce damage. Very limited pharmacokinetic data exist; assume driving/complex tasks are unsafe for at least a full waking cycle after significant doses.",

    "notes": "Reasoning for harm‑reduction additions (with sources): 1) Mislabeling risk is high: both 3‑FMC and 4‑FMC have been sold as “flephedrone”; this explains divergent reports and mandates allergy testing and lab checking when possible. Bluelight threads explicitly discuss the 3‑FMC/4‑FMC confusion; EMCDDA’s cathinone profile lists 4‑FMC as flephedrone and notes NPS are often mis‑sold. 2) Oral vs insufflated risks: user timelines support short, stacked duration with a harsher crash when snorted; several reports describe painful, irritating drips and long tails after repeat lines. Favor oral to reduce nasal damage and compulsive re‑lining. 3) MAOI combos are dangerous with stimulants/MDMA due to hypertensive crisis and serotonin toxicity; this general rule applies to cathinones as mixed monoamine agents. 4) Tramadol and bupropion lower the seizure threshold; both increase seizure risk when combined with stimulants. Avoid. 5) General stimulant harm reduction applies: overheating and hypertension are risks; stay cool, avoid hot environments, plan rest; do not mix multiple stimulants. 6) Injection/rectal use increases harm and has been linked to outbreaks (HIV/HCV) with cathinones in Europe; avoid injecting and share no equipment. 7) Set dosing boundaries to prevent binges: pre‑measure single dose plus at most one booster; lock away remainder; use a milligram scale; avoid multi‑day runs to reduce comedown intensity and sleep deprivation. 8) Hydration: sip small amounts of electrolyte fluids regularly; avoid overhydration; take cooling breaks. 9) Post‑use care: magnesium for bruxism, gentle nutrition, sleep hygiene; avoid alcohol and strong stimulants on the comedown. 10) Space uses generously: at least 2–4 weeks between sessions to let tolerance and mood normalize. 11) Drug checking: use reagents and, where available, lab drug checking services; branded “legal highs” may contain other cathinones (e.g., MDPV) with very different dose ranges. 12) If chest pain, severe agitation, hyperthermia, or persistent tachycardia occurs, seek urgent care and disclose stimulant use. Sources are cited below. Overall toxicity data for 4‑FMC in humans are sparse; guidance extrapolates from related cathinones and HR best practice.",

    "notes": "Gaboxadol is a direct-acting orthosteric GABA-A agonist that preferentially engages extrasynaptic δ-subunit–containing receptors mediating tonic inhibition; this explains deep sedation with less 'benzo-like' disinhibition and has implications for combinations and reversal strategies. Because it does not act at the benzodiazepine site, flumazenil is unlikely to reverse isolated gaboxadol intoxication; management is supportive with airway monitoring, especially if other depressants were involved. High or repeated doses have been associated anecdotally and in development reports with delirium, hallucinations, and amnesia; therefore, avoid pushing beyond the common range and do not stack redoses in one night. Combination with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, benzodiazepines or Z-drugs substantially increases risk for respiratory depression, loss of consciousness, and aspiration; treat these combinations as high-risk and keep doses markedly lower if abstinence from mixing is not maintained. A structural study confirms binding at α4β3δ extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors, providing mechanistic support for potent slow-wave sleep promotion and pronounced motor incoordination; practice 'safe sleep' (no baths, hazards, or tasks) and plan not to drive until fully recovered. User reports indicate variability in time to peak and next-morning grogginess; if experimenting, take the first dose on a quiet night with supervision available and no next-day obligations. A harm-reduction lab warning has identified mis-sold material contaminated with ibotenic acid (an excitotoxic Amanita alkaloid); obtain from trusted sources, consider analytical testing where available, and do not consume products of uncertain identity. Start with an allergy test (~1 mg), then space trials by several days to gauge sensitivity and tolerance build-up; tolerance to GABAergic sedatives often develops quickly and resolves slowly. As with other strong sedatives, people with sleep apnea, chronic lung disease, or unstable cardiovascular disease are at higher risk from nocturnal hypoventilation; these groups should avoid use.",

    "notes": "Rationale 1 – Mechanism and potency vs CBD: Preclinical studies show CBDA suppresses nausea/vomiting and enhances 5‑HT1A receptor activation at doses orders of magnitude lower than CBD; this supports starting with lower doses and anticipating stronger anti‑nausea/anxiolytic effects at small amounts. This also implies additive effects with other 5‑HT1A agents. Rationale 2 – Decarboxylation and preservation: CBDA is the acidic precursor to CBD and decarboxylates upon heating; avoid smoking/vaping or heating tinctures if the intent is to ingest CBDA specifically. Erowid’s cannabis constituents list and cannabinoid chemistry references support that acidic cannabinoids convert to neutral forms with heat/light/time. Store cool, sealed, and away from light to reduce conversion. Rationale 3 – Product verification: Drug checking programs report mislabeling/adulteration of ‘CBD’ oils with potent semi‑synthetic cannabinoids (e.g., Δ9‑THCP) and other add-ins; insist on a recent third‑party COA that quantifies CBDA/CBD and THC and screens for novel cannabinoids. This reduces risk of unexpected intoxication or positive drug tests. Rationale 4 – Anticoagulants: Multiple case reports show CBD raises INR and necessitates warfarin dose reductions; while CBDA‑specific clinical data are sparse, caution is warranted and INR monitoring advised when initiating or changing CBDA due to possible overlapping CYP pathways. Rationale 5 – Benzodiazepines (clobazam): CBD markedly increases active metabolite N‑desmethylclobazam (via CYP2C19 inhibition), increasing sedation; CBDA’s direct effect here is not established but prudence dictates monitoring and starting low if co‑used. Rationale 6 – Psychedelics: Activation of 5‑HT1A receptors can attenuate certain 5‑HT2A‑mediated psychedelic effects in humans (e.g., buspirone blunting psilocybin visuals). CBDA’s 5‑HT1A activity therefore may modestly dampen some psychedelic phenomenology; keep expectations realistic. Rationale 7 – Stability/formulations: A stabilized analogue (CBDA methyl ester, EPM301) was developed because native CBDA is labile; this underscores the need to minimize heat and prolonged storage if retaining CBDA is desired. Additional HR tips: - Start low (e.g., 2–5 mg oral or 1–2 mg sublingual) and titrate by 2–5 mg steps. - Take with a small amount of dietary fat if oral (may aid absorption, as with other cannabinoids). - Space from sedatives by several hours; avoid combining first doses. - If on interacting meds (warfarin, clobazam, narrow TI drugs), involve a clinician and add monitoring (e.g., INR or drug levels) during the first 2–3 weeks after any CBDA change. - Use products with batch COAs; avoid heating CBDA products (baking/vaping) unless conversion to CBD is intended.",

    "notes": "- Identity and purity vary in the unregulated market; drug checking is strongly recommended. Toronto’s Drug Checking Service and similar services often detect unexpected actives in samples; start with an allergy dose and avoid unknown vendors.\n- Combining dissociatives with CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, opioids, GHB/GBL) greatly increases risks of blackout, airway compromise, and respiratory depression; place anyone unconscious in the recovery position and call emergency services.\n- Frequent/heavy arylcyclohexylamine use is linked to ulcerative cystitis and other urinary tract injury (data strongest for ketamine). Given structural similarity and user reports, apply the same precautions to FXE: minimize frequency, stay well‑hydrated during/after use, and stop if urinary pain/urgency/hematuria emerge.\n- Dissociatives can impair coordination and judgment; sit or lie down during peaks, avoid heights/water, and strictly avoid driving/operating machinery until fully baseline the next day. Ketamine references note sedation and slowed breathing at high doses—caution is extrapolated to FXE.\n- High or prolonged dissociative intoxication can precipitate rhabdomyolysis; seek urgent care if you develop severe muscle pain, dark (tea‑colored) urine, or decreased urination after a session.\n- Insufflation irritates nasal mucosa and encourages redosing. To reduce harm: use separate, clean straws; rotate nostrils; space sessions; and gently rinse with sterile saline 15–30 minutes post‑use. General community HR guidance supports nasal care.\n- Intramuscular use has appeared in community reports but carries additional risks (infection, dosing errors). If someone chooses IM, sterile technique, micron filtration, and accurate volumetric dosing are essential; this is not recommended for novices.\n- Tolerance to dissociatives builds rapidly; even weekly use can markedly blunt effects, encouraging escalation. Long breaks (2–4+ weeks) help reset tolerance.\n- FXE is often described as ketamine‑like with unique nuances; individuals vary widely in sensitivity. Dose conservatively, especially if on serotonergic meds (limited human interaction data for FXE; MXE showed SRI activity).\n- Because FXE is sold as a research chemical, mislabeling/adulteration occur. Visually atypical powders and unexpected effects warrant immediate cessation and testing; some user reports describe anomalous batches. ",

    "notes": "Harm-reduction justifications and key points:\n- Steep dose–response: multiple harm-reduction services and Erowid emphasize that 1–2 mg can markedly change intensity; start low and titrate with an accurate 0.001 g scale or volumetric dosing to mitigate accidental overdosing.\n- Intranasal route is far more potent per mg, has rapid onset, and is notably painful; prefer tiny, well-measured amounts or a volumetric nasal spray; expect a shorter, sharper experience.\n- Typical oral active window is ~4–6 h with an additional 2–4 h of residual stimulation; plan set/setting, nutrition, and sleep accordingly.\n- Tablets/pills labeled as 2C-B vary widely and are sometimes confused with MDMA presses; Swiss drug checking shows many different 2C-B presses around ~13–16 mg and occasional mislabeling or admixture; always reagent-test and, where possible, use professional drug checking.\n- Reagent expectations for 2C‑B: Marquis usually yellow→green within ~10–60 s (may darken later), Mecke/Froehde yellowish; Simon’s negative. Read within the first minute and avoid expired reagents to reduce false interpretations.\n- Avoid MAOIs: historical guides and community data warn of significant potentiation and risk when MAOIs are combined with 2C‑x phenethylamines.\n- Combining with strong stimulants or high alcohol loads increases cardiovascular strain and disinhibition; several harm-reduction guides list tachycardia/hypertension among common physical effects of 2C‑x; avoid driving for the rest of the day.\n- MDMA+2C‑B (\"nexus flip\"): commonly reported but increases total serotonergic/stimulant load; if attempted, reduce each dose and stagger timing (e.g., 2C‑B after MDMA peak) to lower risk of overheating, anxiety, and confusion.\n- SSRIs/SNRIs frequently blunt 2C‑x psychedelic effects; cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics is expected for 1–2 weeks—plan adequate spacing.\n- Safer sniffing: if using intranasally, employ fine powder or isotonic solution, avoid caustic adulterants, and rinse with sterile saline after ~20–30 min to reduce mucosal injury.\n- Set/setting and anxiety: even at ‘party’ doses, acute panic can occur; have a trusted sober sitter and benzodiazepines reserved for emergencies only, at minimal doses due to respiratory/coordination risks.\n- Do not rely on blotters labeled 2C‑B: 2C‑B is typically sold as powder/capsules or pressed pills; blotters often indicate NBOMe/NBOH/DOx which have microgram potency and higher risk profiles.\n- Driving/next-day: performance impairment can persist beyond the subjective offset; harm-reduction leaflets advise waiting until the following day (≥24 h) before driving.\n- Hydration/temperature: mild stimulant properties and environment (e.g., clubs) can raise body temperature—sip water regularly, take cool-down breaks, and avoid overhydration.\n- Testing for identity vs. strength: reagent tests confirm likely class but not dose; only a lab or LC–MS quantitation can confirm mg content—assume variability and calibrate dose with your own product.

    "notes": "Evidence-informed harm reduction points and context: (1) Commercial veterinary products (Telazol/Zoletil) contain equimolar zolazepam with tiletamine. After reconstitution, Telazol solution is strongly acidic (pH ≈2.2–2.8), which helps explain reports of intense nasal burn and potential injection-site irritation; this also means sterile, isotonic preparation and low-volume IM administration reduce local irritation. (2) Clean, pure tiletamine HCl (without zolazepam) has circulated on the grey market; user reports consistently describe substantially higher potency than ketamine by weight and a harsher hangover. (3) Numerous community reports describe coarse tremor, disequilibrium, and lingering neurologic symptoms after repeated dosing over hours–days; spacing sessions and avoiding redosing during the active/offset phase is prudent. (4) Dissociative powders are frequently mis-sold or adulterated; drug checking services routinely find dissociatives sold as other drugs (and vice versa), so reagent tests are insufficient to confirm identity and submitting samples for laboratory GC/MS where available is advised. (5) There is little human pharmacokinetic data for tiletamine; extrapolating animal or vet-product data directly to human non-medical use is unreliable. (6) Reagent reference data for tiletamine are scarce/inconsistent; color tests may be misleading, reinforcing the value of professional analysis. (7) If using any veterinary formulation, account for zolazepam: additive sedation and paradoxical interactions with alcohol and GABAergic drugs are possible and can prolong recovery. (8) As with other dissociatives, avoid combining with CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzos) due to increased risk of loss of airway reflexes, emesis with aspiration, and blackouts.",

Long, sometimes biphasic course (often a very late peak and a very long tail) plus severe amnesia can make redosing hazardous; several users report a strong compulsion to redose—remove access to stash and use a sober sitter. Duration commonly exceeds 24 h; plan no driving, machinery, or safety-critical tasks for at least 36–48 h after dosing. Insomnia and agitation are frequent during offset; avoid self-sedating with alcohol or benzos given additive respiratory/CNS depression—seek medical care if severe. Animal studies show rapid NMDA-antagonist vacuolization with high-dose MK-801; human relevance is uncertain but avoiding heavy doses/combos and spacing sessions remains prudent. Injection (IM) has unique risks (sterility, solvent, pH); multiple anecdotal abscess/necrosis cases—best avoided outside clinical settings. Because enantiomer and salt forms can differ in potency and time-course, do not assume one vendor’s dose applies to another. Use reagent/lab testing where available; misidentified dissociatives circulate. First exposure: ≤0.25 mg single dose, no redose, and allow ≥14 days between trials.

    "notes": "Reasoning for additions and harm-reduction guidance: 1) Dosing and onset: Multiple reputable sources place typical oral doses around 70–150 mg, with a slow 30–90 min onset and long duration. Slow onset encourages risky redosing if people expect MDMA-like timing. Waiting a full 2–3 hours before any redose reduces overdose and adverse-event risk. Sources: Erowid Piperazines Basics; EMCDDA/EUDA risk assessment. 2) Duration/after-effects: Reports consistently describe 6–10 h total duration with insomnia, headache, and stimulation into the next day, which impacts driving and next-day functioning; plan for sleep hygiene and a recovery window. Sources: Erowid Piperazines Basics; DrugWise BZP page. 3) Composition/adulteration: BZP historically appeared in 'party pills' often mixed with TFMPP and/or caffeine; tablets and powders may be mis-sold as MDMA. Use reliable drug checking services when available and don’t assume pill logos indicate MDMA. Sources: EMCDDA/EUDA risk assessment; Erowid BZP vault; DrugWise BZP page. 4) Pharmacology/serotonergic cautions: BZP shows amphetamine-like monoamine releasing effects and evidence of serotonergic activity; combining with SSRIs/SNRIs or other serotonergic agents (especially TFMPP) may increase serotonin syndrome risk. Avoid with MAOIs entirely due to risk of hypertensive crisis. Sources: Erowid neuropharmacology note; EMCDDA/EUDA risk assessment. 5) Cardiovascular/seizure risks: Adverse events include tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, anxiety, headache, nausea and seizures—risks rise with higher doses, heat, dehydration, and polydrug use. People with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, seizure disorders, or significant anxiety should avoid. Sources: EMCDDA/EUDA risk assessment; DrugWise BZP page. 6) Heat, hydration and environment: As a stimulant, BZP can increase body temperature and impair thermoregulation. In hot crowded venues, take cooling breaks, avoid heavy exertion, sip small amounts of water regularly (avoid overhydration), and replace electrolytes. Sources: DrugWise general stimulant cautions. 7) Redosing/spacing: Tolerance to stimulant-like effects can build rapidly across days; spacing use by at least 1–2 weeks reduces compulsive redosing and adverse after-effects. Data are mostly anecdotal but consistent with stimulant patterns. Sources: EMCDDA/EUDA risk assessment; Erowid piperazines content. 8) Alcohol and caffeine: Mixing with alcohol can mask intoxication and stress the heart; caffeine adds to jitteriness, anxiety, and palpitations—keep doses low or avoid. Sources: DrugWise BZP and general stimulant cautions. 9) Legal status: BZP is controlled in many jurisdictions (e.g., EU control measure 2008; US Schedule I). Carrying across borders can lead to prosecution. Sources: EMCDDA/EUDA; Isomerdesign legal summaries. 10) Measuring dose: Effects vary widely; weigh doses with a milligram scale and avoid eyeballing, especially with unknown salt forms (base vs. HCl). PubChem entry confirms HCl salt existence; potency by mass differs between salt and base.",

    "notes": "2C-B-FLY’s oral onset can be slow and variable (20–180+ minutes), so redosing early carries a real overshoot risk; wait at least 3 hours before considering any additional dose. Mislabeling events in 2009 involved Bromo-DragonFLY being sold as 2C-B-FLY; the former is far more potent, longer-lasting, and notably more vasoconstrictive—use reagent tests as a preliminary screen only and prefer GC/MS drug checking when feasible; treat unknown batches with allergy tests (≤1 mg) and conservative titration. Insufflation is commonly reported as extremely painful for 2C-x and specifically for 2C-B-FLY; it tends to shorten duration and roughen the come-up—oral is generally preferred for predictability. As with phenethylamine psychedelics, expect transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure; those with cardiovascular, seizure, or bipolar disorders should avoid or consult a clinician. Salt form affects mass: most references cite the HCl or HBr salts; HBr typically requires roughly 10–20% more mass than HCl for equivalent base—always calculate by salt and weigh accurately. Because of the slow come-up and moderate length, plan set/setting, hydration, and recovery time; avoid combining with stimulants, tramadol, or MAOIs. If effects escalate well past 12 hours with pronounced cold/numb extremities and severe vasoconstriction, suspect misidentification (e.g., Bromo-DragonFLY) and seek medical care; do not redose or take vasoconstrictors. As with all psychedelics, cross-tolerance with other 5-HT2A agonists occurs for several days; spacing experiences by 2+ weeks helps restore baseline sensitivity and reduces compulsive redosing pressure.",

    "notes": "1P‑LSD first appeared circa 2014–2015 and is widely believed to act as a prodrug for LSD: incubation in human serum yields LSD, and subjective time‑course is near‑identical to LSD for most users. Start low because potency equivalence to LSD varies across labs/batches and human data are mixed; community surveys tend to find similar duration and slightly weaker average strength than LSD, but animal HTR potency is lower and inter‑batch variability is large. Blotter dose labels are often imprecise; consider that actual content may deviate ±15–30%. Reagent testing: 1‑acyl lysergamides may show a delayed/weak Ehrlich reaction (pink to light purple over 15–30+ minutes); use a clean ceramic surface, pre‑wet the blotter with a drop of water, and prefer multi‑reagent or laboratory drug checking where available; note that adulteration with tryptamine has been used to fake Ehrlich‑positive results. Redosing the same day is typically inefficient due to rapid 5‑HT2A tolerance; spacing at least 2 weeks between sessions helps restore sensitivity. Avoid mixing with lithium or TCAs due to consistent reports of severe reactions and seizures; if you take prescription psychoactives, consult a clinician. Plan set/setting, have a trusted sober sitter for higher doses, and avoid unsafe environments; impairments can persist into the next day—do not drive or operate machinery until fully baseline. Store blotters airtight, light/heat/oxygen protected (foil, desiccant, cold), to limit degradation and inadvertent hydrolysis to LSD over time. People with a personal or family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder should avoid serotonergic psychedelics due to elevated risk of adverse psychiatric events.",

    "notes": "- Identity and nomenclature: MAL is 3,5-dimethoxy-4-methallyloxyphenethylamine; the methallyl (2‑methylallyl) ether at the 4-position makes it an escaline-family analogue. This specific naming helps distinguish it from mescaline analogues with 3,4,5-trimethoxy patterns. (Source: PiHKAL·info entry and IUPAC listing).\n- Very slow, sometimes deceptive onset (60–120 min) is frequently reported; premature redosing is a common cause of excessive body-load and adverse effects—avoid any redose before 3 hours and consider split-dosing only after prior experience. (Anecdotal consensus across BL/Erowid).\n- Long duration (10–16 h) plus residual after-effects can impact sleep and next-day function; don’t drive, cycle, swim, or operate machinery during and after. Plan an unhurried, temperature‑controlled setting with trusted support.\n- Nausea and GI cramping are common in the first hours; bland pre-meal, ginger/peppermint, and avoiding heavy fats can help. Some find sublingual/insufflation reduces nausea but increases stimulation and local irritation. (Anecdotal).\n- Peripheral stimulation/vasoconstriction and mild hypertension can occur; combining with stimulants (including high-dose caffeine) increases cardiovascular strain—avoid such mixes, especially if you have cardiovascular risk factors. (General HR + TripSit chart rationale).\n- Urinary retention has been repeatedly reported anecdotally with moderate–high doses; inability to void for many hours is a red flag. Avoid anticholinergics (e.g., diphenhydramine), stay hydrated with electrolytes, and seek urgent care if painful retention persists (>6–8 h), if there’s flank pain, or if you feel systemically unwell. Do not self‑medicate with prescription alpha‑blockers without medical supervision. (Anecdotal; community warnings).\n- Salt forms: “MAL fumarate” has appeared in drug checking contexts and can be laid on blotter. Salt form changes mg‑for‑mg potency by mass; if unknown, titrate from the low end and do an allergy test with each new batch.\n- Reagent/drug checking: MAL has been found on blotter, a format often used for long‑acting phenethylamines; always test. Reagents may not be definitive; GC/MS (e.g., DrugsData) or a local service provides confirmation.\n- Allergy test: For any new batch, especially RCs, start with 1–2 mg to screen idiosyncratic reactions, then stepwise titrate on a different day.\n- Mental set: As with other psychedelics, strong alterations in thought and perception occur; having a sober sitter, a plan for anxiety management (breathing, environment control), and avoiding emotionally charged settings reduces risk.\n- Medical cautions: People with BPH/prostate issues, urinary tract problems, uncontrolled hypertension, or significant cardiovascular disease should avoid MAL without medical clearance due to retention and BP risks.\n- Do not mix with lithium (seizure/coma risk reported with psychedelics) or MAOIs (unpredictable potentiation and hypertension risk). Tramadol is risky due to serotonergic and seizure‑threshold effects.\n- Hydration: Sip fluids regularly; add electrolytes if sweating or active. Overhydration can be harmful—avoid chugging large volumes rapidly.\n- Sleep protection: Expect sleep disruption; prepare a dark, quiet space and non-pharmacologic sleep hygiene rather than sedative stacking post‑trip.",

    "notes": "- Clinically documented intoxications (STRIDA, Sweden, 2014 cohort) showed hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and severe cases requiring hospitalization 1–3 days; polysubstance co-use was present in 87% of cases. This underscores the danger of combining with other psychoactives.\n- TripSit and community reports place oral onset at 15–30 minutes with 2–5 hours of main effects and 4–24 hours of after-effects (insomnia, cognitive fog), so plan set/setting and sleep hygiene accordingly.\n- Vaporizing/smoking produces a much steeper onset and is associated with airway irritation and strong compulsion to redose; at least one detailed user report required bronchodilator therapy after vaping. Avoid this ROA if you have any respiratory issues.\n- Identity errors have occurred in the market (e.g., D2PM shipped as diphenidine). Always reagent-test and, where available, use laboratory drug checking; never assume vendor labels are accurate.\n- Combining with CNS depressants (opioids, benzos, alcohol) markedly increases risks of loss of consciousness and aspiration; combination charts and HR wikis flag these as high risk. If emergency sedation is needed (e.g., agitation), medical settings often use benzodiazepines with monitoring; do not attempt to self-sedate.\n- Dissociatives can cause amnesia, ataxia, wandering, and accidents at strong doses. Use a sober sitter, restrict access to hazards, and avoid public spaces. Community threads repeatedly highlight “blank-slate” episodes with impaired recall.\n- Rapid pharmacodynamic tolerance develops (within-session) and cross-tolerance exists across dissociatives. To reduce escalation, space sessions by at least 1–2 weeks and avoid redosing cycles in the same 24 h.\n- Because human pharmacokinetics are poorly characterized, avoid stacking doses; residual effects can linger into the next day. Use precise weighing (≥1 mg resolution) and consider volumetric dosing for sub-20 mg measurements.\n- Nasal use can be harsh; rinsing with sterile saline after insufflation may reduce local irritation per general HR practice. Prefer non-inhalational routes to protect lungs.\n- If you feel unwell (e.g., severe agitation, chest pain, collapsed), seek medical help and be candid about substances taken; hospital teams have treated such cases and monitor for hypertensive crises, arrhythmias, and severe agitation.

    "notes": "• 1cP-LSD (1-cyclopropionyl-lysergic acid diethylamide) is an N‑1 acylated lysergamide that functions as a prodrug to LSD; in vitro human-serum work and animal behavior show conversion to LSD and LSD‑like action. Expect essentially classic LSD pharmacology. [Brandt 2020; community corroboration]\n• Relative potency per microgram is reported as similar to or modestly below LSD; do not assume equi-potency across batches—start low with new sources. [Erowid/Bluelight user reports]\n• Reagent testing: use an indole test (Ehrlich) AND a lysergamide-specific test (Hofmann). Ehrlich can show false-positives on gel tabs or with other indoles (e.g., melatonin); Hofmann should develop blue/purplish for lysergamides over up to ~60 min. Use Marquis/Mecke to help rule out NBOMe/DOx. [Reddit ReagentTesting threads referencing Erowid guidance]\n• Volumetric dosing is strongly recommended for accurate titration with microgram-active drugs. Prepare a measured solution (e.g., in ethanol/water), label clearly, and calculate dose with a volumetric converter. [TripSit]\n• Storage stability: light, heat, oxygen, and moisture accelerate lysergamide degradation. For longer storage, keep blotters/pellets in airtight, lightproof containers with desiccant; refrigerate/freezer storage can extend shelf-life. Warm to room temp before opening to avoid condensation. [Bluelight HR FAQ]\n• Mental health: avoid if history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or uncontrolled severe anxiety. Use sitter, safe setting, and have a de-escalation plan. [General HR consensus]\n• Rescue plan: a benzodiazepine (e.g., 1–2 mg lorazepam or 5–10 mg diazepam) can quell panic, but avoid preloading and mixing with alcohol/other depressants. Seek medical help for chest pain, seizures, or extreme agitation. [HR org guidance]\n• HPPD/lingering visuals are uncommon but documented after LSD-like experiences; risk may rise with frequent/high-dose use and concurrent cannabis. Space sessions, especially after difficult trips. [HR summaries]\n• Driving and tasks requiring full attention: impairment can persist beyond the subjective end of effects; wait at least 24 hours before driving. [Hi‑Ground]\n• Cross-tolerance: strong with LSD and other 5‑HT2A psychedelics; spacing 7–14 days between sessions reduces tolerance and psychological wear. [Bluelight HR FAQ]\n• Legal status varies and changes frequently; in some jurisdictions 1cP‑LSD is controlled or may be treated as an analogue of LSD. Verify locally before purchase/possession/use.

    "notes": "- Naming and supply: MXM is widely discussed as 'Methoxmetamine' or simply 'MXM'; it has also been sold under confusing vendor labels like 'e-Methoxetamine'. Confusion with MXE and other 2-oxo arylcyclohexylamines has occurred; identity verification via reagent tests and, where available, GC/MS drug checking is strongly advised. In some markets, ketamine samples have been found to actually contain other arylcyclohexylamines (e.g., MXE), underscoring the value of checking.\n- ROA efficiency: Early reports consistently describe poor nasal efficacy and irritation with MXM; oral/sublingual routes produce more reliable effects for most users at comparable or lower totals.\n- Onset/plateau: Compared to MXE, MXM typically comes on faster and runs shorter (often ~2–3 h), which can encourage compulsive redosing—pre-weigh doses and set a firm maximum before starting.\n- Tolerance: Dissociative tolerance rises quickly, sometimes after a single strong session, and cross-tolerance with ketamine/MXE/other arylcyclohexylamines is expected. Allow long breaks (≥2 weeks) between sessions to reduce escalation.\n- Bladder/urinary risk: Like other dissociatives, repeated/frequent use is associated with urinary tract problems (urgency, frequency, pain). Stop use and seek medical evaluation if symptoms appear; spacing sessions and maintaining hydration may reduce risk.\n- Mental health: MXM can produce agitation or hypomanic qualities in some users; avoid if you have a history of psychosis or bipolar disorder, and do not combine with stimulants during/after high doses. Ensure a safe environment and sober support if experimenting with unfamiliar doses.\n- IM-specific HR: If choosing IM, use new sterile equipment, sterile water, proper site cleaning (single swipe with alcohol swab, let dry), rotate sites, and consider a 0.22–0.30 µm filter to reduce insoluble particles/endotoxin. Avoid IV due to very rapid onset and loss of motor control.\n- Driving and hazards: Severe impairment of coordination, balance and situational awareness occurs; plan not to drive or operate machinery for at least 24 hours after use.\n- Volumetric dosing and scales: Because redosing and impaired judgment are common on dissociatives, pre-measure doses with a 0.001 g scale; volumetric solutions can improve accuracy and reduce accidental heavy intakes.",

Therefore, always reagent‑test and, where possible, use a laboratory drug‑checking service before dosing.\n- Overheating and over‑hydration are both established risks with serotonergic entactogens. Use cooling/rest breaks; sip fluids regularly but avoid excessive plain water. Prefer electrolyte‑containing drinks or salty snacks to prevent hyponatremia.\n- Serotonergic polypharmacy meaningfully increases the chance of serotonin toxicity. Avoid combinations with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM, and similar agents. This is reflected in TripSit's interaction guidance and community safety lists.\n- Reports with benzofurans (e.g., 5‑MAPB) frequently include jaw tension/bruxism, vasoconstriction, insomnia, and desire to redose; magnesium may reduce jaw clenching for some, but evidence is anecdotal—do not exceed daily limits. Keep doses modest and avoid stacking stimulants.\n- Space sessions widely (commonly ≥4–6 weeks) to reduce mood dips and tolerance; frequent MDMA‑like use worsens after‑effects. This timing is an inference from MDMA harm‑reduction practice and reported hangovers.\n- Insufflation is more likely to cause local irritation and sharp cardiovascular peaks; oral is generally safer/steadier for benzofurans per community experience.\n- During long, hot, or high‑exertion settings (clubs/festivals), plan for cooling, electrolytes, and set dose limits in advance to avoid compulsive redosing.

[Rationale: 2024–2025 drug checking findings; DrugWise xylazine brief.]\n• Avoid combining with any depressants (alcohol, benzos, Z‑drugs, barbiturates, GHB/GBL) due to strong additive respiratory depression; many fatal overdoses involve these combos. [Rationale: general harm reduction guidance; Erowid opioid cautions.]\n• Ready‑to‑use nasal sprays have been seized on the market; mg/mL concentration may be unknown or uneven. If using, ensure a verified concentration, shake/prime before use, and start with a single measured spray. [Rationale: EUDA reporting of illicit nasal sprays.]\n• Post‑reversal monitoring: subjective effects may fade before the drug clears, especially with high‑potency opioid mixes; monitor for several hours after naloxone to prevent re‑narcotization. [Rationale: general opioid pharmacology and EUDA harm‑reduction focus.]\n• Test what you can: fentanyl test strips do not detect nitazenes; a negative FTS does not prove samples are free of other high‑potency opioids/sedatives. [Rationale: Hi‑Ground nitazene guidance.]\n• Handling safety: avoid aerosolizing powder; minimize skin contact and inhalation exposure when preparing solutions; label all solutions with substance and concentration. [Rationale: EUDA warns of accidental exposure via skin/inhalation; TripSit volumetric dosing practices.]\n• Dependence and tolerance can escalate rapidly; large day‑to‑day dose changes markedly increase overdose risk, especially after short abstinence (‘lost tolerance’). [Rationale: Erowid opioid tolerance warning.]\n• Consider non‑injecting routes if dependent and unable to abstain; if injecting, use sterile equipment, rotate sites, and use sterile water/filters to reduce infection risk. [Rationale: standard HR; aligns with EUDA ‘health and social responses’ guidance.]",

    "notes": "2C-B-AN appears to be an aminonitrile prodrug intended to convert in vivo to 2C-B; community chemistry threads and user reports describe it as such, but there are no formal PK studies, so expect variability in onset and potency. Given the prodrug nature, onset is often slower (~1 h) than 2C-B and redosing too early risks stacking into an overly intense peak several hours later; wait at least 2 hours between doses. Compared with 2C-B, typical oral doses are substantially higher (tens of milligrams), which increases the risk of dosing error; always weigh with a milligram scale and consider volumetric dosing for accuracy. Because 2C-B products are commonly found in pressed pills in nightlife markets and may be confused with MDMA, use lab drug checking where available; 2C-B pills on European services often contain ~10–20 mg and small adulterants have been observed. For 2C-B itself, nasal use is notoriously painful and can cause significant local irritation; for 2C-B-AN, human data by this route are very limited, so oral administration is preferred. Avoid combining with MAOIs or lithium: MAOIs can markedly potentiate phenethylamine psychedelics with hypertension risk, and lithium with classical psychedelics has been associated with seizures and severe adverse reactions in community safety lists. Tramadol lowers seizure threshold and is serotonergic; avoid co-use due to seizure/serotonin toxicity risk. DXM is serotonergic/dissociative and can unpredictably intensify psychedelic effects; harm-reduction lists flag this as a dangerous combination despite some subjective synergy reports. As a little-studied prodrug with a nitrile motif, long-term toxicity and metabolism are not characterized; minimize frequency of use, avoid high/repeated doses, and keep a sober sitter for first trials. Set and setting strongly shape outcomes; avoid if you have a personal or family history of psychosis, and allow at least 2 weeks between psychedelic sessions to reduce tolerance.",

    "notes": "REASONS AND SOURCES FOR EACH HARM-REDUCTION POINT (added fields below follow these justifications):\n- Dose sensitivity and weighing: Multiple HR sources list a narrow active range (roughly 5–20 mg orally) with big effect jumps per few milligrams, so precise weighing is essential. The Drug Users Bible compiles ranges and explicitly notes dose sensitivity; Drugs‑Forum and Erowid archives echo this. Therefore, clear dose brackets and scale/volumetric dosing guidance are warranted.\n- Onset variability and redose risk: TripSit documents oral onset variability, sometimes taking up to 3 hours. Early redosing risks overshooting once the delayed come‑up arrives. So the onset window in duration and a note to wait at least 3 hours before considering any redose are included.\n- Route harms (insufflation): TripSit lists intranasal use with shorter total duration but, in practice, users report severe nasal pain and harsher body load. Because this ROA increases acute adverse effects, I flag it as strongly discouraged and avoid providing numeric doses.\n- Duration planning and after‑effects: Hi‑Ground’s 2C‑x guidance lists 2C‑E total 6–10 h with after‑effects up to 24 h, aligning with user reports; thus the duration curve includes a conservative envelope for planning.\n- Interactions: TripSit’s combination chart and write‑ups consistently flag MAOIs as dangerous with 2C‑x phenethylamines and warn about serotonin/seizure risks with tramadol; community HR threads also warn against lithium with classic psychedelics. Accordingly, MAOIs, tramadol, and lithium are set to “dangerous”, while DXM and stimulants are “unsafe,” and SSRIs, alcohol, cannabis, and benzos are placed under “caution.”\n- Reagent testing and misrepresentation risk: To reduce the risk of misidentified materials (e.g., 2C‑x being sold as MDMA or vice versa), I added explicit reagent expectations for 2C‑E (Marquis: no reaction; Mandelin: yellow/green; Mecke: brown) sourced from Drugs‑Forum’s reagent table. Saferparty’s alerts show 2C‑x pills mis-sold as MDMA, underscoring the need for multi‑reagent testing.\n- Volumetric dosing feasibility and solution stability: TripSit notes ~50 mg/mL aqueous solubility and reasonable solution stability for 2C‑E HCl, but crystallization can occur below room temperature—supporting advice to use dilute solutions, label clearly, and store at room temp away from light.\n- Set/setting and mental intensity: TripSit emphasizes 2C‑E’s heavy body load and strong visuals; prudent advice includes calm set/setting, sitter for higher doses, and avoiding crowded/overstimulating contexts for inexperienced users.\n- Driving/operating machinery: Hi‑Ground recommends not driving for at least 24 hours after 2C‑x use; included under practical safety.\n- Tolerance spacing: Community consensus for 5‑HT2A psychedelics suggests noticeable tolerance for days and near‑baseline by 1–2 weeks; I preserved your existing tolerance windows and note cross‑tolerance to other psychedelics. Data quality here is anecdotal; users should allow ample time between sessions.\n\nAPPLIED HARM-REDUCTION DETAILS (reflected in the JSON fields): 2C‑E often produces stronger body load than some other 2C‑x; effects escalate steeply with dose, so start low and avoid redosing during the first 3 hours. Use a calibrated 0.001 g scale or volumetric dosing to avoid mis-measurement; 2C‑E HCl dissolves in water (approx. ≤50 mg/mL) but can recrystallize if chilled. Always multi‑test unknown samples with reagents; expected 2C‑E reactions include Marquis: no reaction, Mecke: brown, Mandelin: yellow/green—reagents do not confirm purity or dose. Be aware that 2C‑x tablets are sometimes mis‑sold as MDMA; strong set/setting control and a trusted sober sitter are recommended for higher doses. Avoid MAOIs, lithium, and tramadol; avoid combining with other stimulants or DXM; SSRIs may blunt effects; cannabis can potentiate visuals and anxiety; alcohol adds nausea/dehydration and impairs judgment. Insufflation is strongly discouraged due to severe nasal pain and spikier adverse effects. Maintain moderate ambient temperature, sip water regularly (not excessively), and avoid driving for at least 24 hours post‑use. Those with cardiovascular disease, seizure history, or severe anxiety should avoid use or seek medical advice.",

    "notes": "Bromazepam is a prescription benzodiazepine anxiolytic that positively modulates GABA-A receptors; it has an oral Tmax of about 1–4 hours and an elimination half-life around 10–20 hours, with an active metabolite (3-hydroxybromazepam). Using it with other CNS depressants (notably alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL) markedly increases risk of profound sedation and respiratory depression; this combination is overrepresented in overdose data and should be avoided. Co-use with gabapentinoids or Z‑drugs adds sedation and psychomotor impairment; avoid or minimize doses and separate timing if medically unavoidable. Benzodiazepines impair driving and operating machinery; next‑day impairment can persist even when you ‘feel fine’, especially after night dosing or higher doses—do not drive within at least 8–12 hours of a strong dose. Older adults are more sensitive and have slower clearance, increasing falls, fractures, and confusion; doses should be lower and durations shorter. Dependence can develop with weeks of regular use; never stop suddenly after repeated use—taper gradually under medical supervision to avoid severe withdrawal, including seizures. Flumazenil can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent or mixed‑overdose settings; its use requires specialist oversight. Avoid in severe respiratory disease, significant hepatic impairment, sleep apnea, or a history of substance use disorder unless closely supervised. In pregnancy or breastfeeding, benzodiazepines are generally avoided unless necessary; if dependent during pregnancy, guidelines favor gradual dose reduction using long‑acting benzodiazepines under specialist care rather than abrupt cessation. Illicit markets in Europe and elsewhere have widespread counterfeit benzodiazepine tablets containing potent ‘designer’ benzos or even synthetic opioids; only use medicine from a verified prescription supply to reduce poisoning risk. Anterograde amnesia, disinhibition, and paradoxical agitation can occur; take initial test doses in a safe setting and avoid decisions, conflict, or public settings while affected.",

    "notes": "Harm-reduction justifications and updates (see citations): 1) Prodrug/active metabolite: Approximately 30% of a given dose is metabolized to phenmetrazine, which contributes to both clinical effect and abuse potential. Individuals with higher conversion may experience stronger effects and be more prone to redosing. This underlies the need for cautious titration and avoidance of tampering with ER products. 2) Half-life and accumulation: DrugBank reports an apparent elimination half-life of 19–24 hours. Even if the subjective effect window is shorter (IR ~4–6 h; ER ~8–12 h), late-day dosing increases insomnia risk and next-day stimulation; spacing doses and avoiding evening dosing reduces sleep disruption. 3) Food interaction: Take 1 hour before meals; food can delay absorption and blunt peak, which can lead to premature or excessive redosing. 4) Short-term only: Indicated as a short-term adjunct (‘a few weeks’) to caloric restriction; tachyphylaxis/tolerance is expected with ongoing daily use, so extended continuous use raises risks with diminishing benefit. 5) Renal elimination and urinary pH: The drug and its metabolites are primarily renally excreted. Urinary alkalinization (e.g., acetazolamide, bicarbonate) can decrease excretion and raise plasma levels; urinary acidification has the opposite effect. Avoid deliberate pH manipulation. 6) MAOI combinations are contraindicated: MAOIs combined with sympathomimetic amines can precipitate hypertensive crises; this extends to linezolid and methylene blue due to MAOI properties. Maintain at least a 14‑day washout from MAOIs before/after use. 7) Cardiovascular screening: Avoid use with cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, or glaucoma; monitor BP/HR during use. 8) ER tampering and non-oral routes: Extended-release beads are not for crushing or insufflation; tampering defeats controlled release and increases overdose and adverse event risk. The prodrug still requires metabolism; non-oral misuse adds harm without reliable benefit. 9) Heat, hydration, and exertion: Stimulants increase heat production and reduce appetite/thirst awareness; maintain hydration and avoid strenuous exercise/sauna/heat exposure on dose days. 10) Sleep and mental health: Plan dosing early; do not redose late to chase appetite suppression. Stimulant use can exacerbate anxiety or precipitate agitation; discontinue and seek care for chest pain, dyspnea, severe headache, confusion, or hallucinations.",

    "notes": "3‑CAF is a positional isomer of the neurotoxic para‑chloroamphetamine (PCA); animal literature on PCA shows profound, long‑lasting serotonergic depletion, hence caution is warranted when experimenting with any chloro‑substituted amphetamine despite sparse human data on 3‑CAF. Human use reports for 3‑CAF are scarce; subjective effects are described as ‘MDMA‑lite’ empathy plus typical amphetamine stimulation with relatively clean headspace. Because of monoamine release, hyperthermia, jaw clenching/bruxism, tachycardia and insomnia are common at higher doses; plan cool‑down breaks and avoid hot, crowded venues. Hydration should be moderate and include electrolytes (e.g., ~250–500 mL per hour while dancing, less at rest); over‑hydration can cause hyponatremia—sip rather than chug and include salts. Due to overlapping serotonergic mechanisms, combinations with MAOIs, DXM, tramadol, lithium, triptans, St John’s wort, 5‑HTP or other serotonergic releasers greatly increase serotonin syndrome risk; stop use and seek medical help if clonus, agitation, hyperthermia, or confusion occur. Many amphetamines (and MDMA) are CYP2D6 substrates; potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion) may increase exposure and side‑effects—dose conservatively and avoid redosing. Reagent tests cannot reliably distinguish positional isomers; GC/MS‑based drug checking is strongly recommended to exclude para‑chloroamphetamines (PCA/4‑CMA) which have been reported in the market and are strongly serotonergic‑neurotoxic. Space sessions by at least 4 weeks to limit tolerance and potential serotonergic stress; avoid multi‑day binges and sleep deprivation. Always weigh doses on a 0.001 g (milligram) scale; consider an initial 1–2 mg allergy test due to unknown individual sensitivity. Avoid driving/heavy machinery during effects and for several hours after due to residual stimulation and sleep loss.",

    "notes": "• Unconfirmed/phantom status: 2C‑BZ appears on community “unconfirmed NPS” lists, with no widely published analytical confirmations. Treat any sample labeled “2C‑BZ” as suspect until GC‑MS/LC‑MS confirms identity. Color reagents/FTIR cannot reliably distinguish rare analogues or positional isomers; only laboratory mass spectrometry can. • Mislabeling risk is non‑trivial: Dutch drug‑checking alerts have found pills sold as 2C‑B that instead contained a positional isomer (4,5‑dimethoxy‑2‑bromophenethylamine). Assume similar risks for anything marketed as “2C‑BZ”. • Use professional drug‑checking where available. Lab services (e.g., DrugsData) and municipal drug‑checking programs can confirm contents; reports emphasize both the value and limits of FTIR/reagents versus GC‑MS/HR‑LC‑MS. • Potency may be in the single‑digit milligram range according to scattered reports; overdose is plausible if the product is actually a different, more potent compound (e.g., NBOMe/DOx). Employ allergy testing (≤1 mg) and volumetric dosing; wait at least 2–3 hours before redosing due to variable phenethylamine onsets. • Expect typical 2C‑x adverse effects: stimulation, vasoconstriction, jaw tension, nausea. Avoid stacking with other stimulants or pressors; monitor hydration and body temperature in warm environments. • Antidepressant co‑administration: SSRIs/SNRIs often blunt psychedelic effects; MAOIs are a red‑flag combination with 2C‑x phenethylamines. Tramadol and DXM are riskier due to seizure and serotonin‑toxicity potential. • Because many “2C‑BZ” samples may be misidentified 2C‑x/DOx/NBOMe, avoid non‑oral routes; insufflation especially increases hazard with unknown potency and adulterants.",

It is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam, which is glucuronidated and renally eliminated; inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolides, protease inhibitors) and grapefruit can markedly increase sedation and duration, while inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) can reduce effects. Profound respiratory depression, apnea, hypotension, and coma can occur, especially with opioids, alcohol, or other depressants; parenteral use should only occur with continuous monitoring and immediate access to airway/resuscitation equipment. Anterograde amnesia is prominent and may cause blackouts and hazardous redosing; ensure precise measurement, avoid mixing with alcohol, and have a trusted sober person if sedated. Paradoxical agitation, disinhibition, or aggression can occur, particularly in those with alcohol misuse history, psychiatric comorbidity, or at high doses. Older adults, those with hepatic dysfunction, heart failure, or renal impairment are at increased risk of prolonged sedation and adverse events due to reduced clearance and active metabolite accumulation. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided until fully alert; residual psychomotor impairment can outlast perceived sedation. Abrupt discontinuation after repeated use can precipitate severe withdrawal (including seizures); gradual medical tapering is essential for dependent individuals. Flumazenil can reverse benzodiazepine effects but is contraindicated in many mixed overdoses and in benzodiazepine dependence due to seizure risk; emergency medical care and supportive airway management are first-line in suspected overdose.",

    "notes": "Etizolam is prescribed in Japan and India under brand names like Depas, Pasaden, Etilaam, Etizola, and Etizest, but is unapproved in many other countries; in unregulated markets it often appears as pressed tablets or powders of uncertain dose. Counterfeit 'benzo' tablets and blister packs may contain etizolam or other designer benzodiazepines; use drug checking services when possible and do not assume branding equals content. Compared dose-for-dose, 1 mg etizolam is commonly estimated around 10 mg diazepam in anxiolytic/sedative effect; individual response varies, so start low to avoid blackouts. Onset is relatively fast (roughly 10–40 minutes), and redosing during the come-up markedly increases the risk of amnesia, disinhibition, accidents, and respiratory depression, especially if other depressants are onboard. As a CYP3A4 substrate, etizolam’s levels can be increased by potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., some azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, fluvoxamine) and reduced by inducers (e.g., carbamazepine); this can unpredictably strengthen or weaken effects. Mixing with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, or Z‑drugs greatly raises overdose risk (compounded sedation, hypoventilation, aspiration); avoid concurrent use and seek help immediately if someone cannot be roused or breathes slowly or irregularly. In several drug checking datasets, benzo-adulterants, including etizolam, appear in expected-fentanyl samples—be vigilant if using opioids, as combined depressants drive severe poisonings. Withdrawal after sustained or high-dose use can produce severe rebound anxiety, insomnia, tremor, and seizures; never abruptly stop after regular use—medical supervision and gradual tapering are strongly advised. Driving or operating machinery is unsafe while under the influence and can remain unsafe the next morning because of residual sedation and psychomotor impairment. Volumetric dosing (diluting a known small mass into a measured volume) reduces dosing error with powders/solutions; avoid eyeballing or 'drops' from unknown-concentration liquids. Intranasal and especially injection routes are discouraged due to poor solubility, binders, infection risk, and unpredictable kinetics—oral or sublingual are the least risky non-medical routes. Packaging and appearance are unreliable indicators of content; use reagent tests and, where available, GC/MS drug checking to verify. Store powders/solutions cool, dry, and protected from light to limit degradation, and keep all benzodiazepines secured to prevent accidental pediatric/naïve exposure.",

    "notes": "• Prazepam is a long‑acting benzodiazepine prodrug whose primary active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam (nordazepam), has an extremely long and variable half‑life; with repeated dosing, effects and impairment can accumulate across days. Plan doses conservatively and avoid redosing within the same day unless fully assessed for residual sedation. Sources: DrugBank half‑life and CYP3A4 substrate listing; TripSit/Bluelight tables.\n• Mixing benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, Z‑drugs) markedly increases the risk of fatal respiratory depression, blackout, and accidental injury; this combination drives a large share of drug‑related deaths. If any depressant has been used, skip further benzodiazepines and never ‘stack’ them to sleep. Sources: TripSit benzodiazepine harm‑reduction page; Erowid benzo caution.\n• Grapefruit and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can raise prazepam/nordazepam exposure; DrugBank explicitly lists ‘avoid grapefruit’ and categorizes prazepam as a CYP3A4 substrate. Avoid grapefruit juice/products during use and for at least 48–72 h around dosing. Source: DrugBank food interactions/CYP3A4 substrate category.\n• Contraindications and cautions include severe hepatic insufficiency (risk of encephalopathy), severe respiratory insufficiency, and sleep apnoea; start at reduced doses and titrate slowly in older or debilitated adults. Source: product‑style monograph reproduced on Drugs‑Forum.\n• Therapeutic courses should be as short as possible (commonly ≤8–12 weeks including taper). Physical dependence can develop within weeks; abrupt cessation may precipitate severe withdrawal (anxiety rebound, agitation, seizures) and should be avoided. Taper gradually under supervision. Sources: Drugs‑Forum monograph; TripSit warnings that benzo withdrawal can be fatal.\n• Driving and hazardous tasks: next‑day cognitive/motor impairment is common with long‑acting benzodiazepines. Do not drive or operate machinery during acute effects, after dose increases, or the morning after evening dosing—especially with polydrug use or sleep debt. Source: TripSit HR page (explicit ‘inability to drive’).\n• Dose equivalence varies between tables; a commonly cited range is prazepam 10–20 mg ≈ diazepam 10 mg, with one clinical compilation listing 15 mg ≈ 10 mg diazepam. Use equivalence only as rough guidance when switching, then cross‑titrate carefully. Sources: TripSit benzo table; Bluelight equivalency post.\n• Caffeine can subjectively mask sedation without restoring psychomotor performance; DrugBank lists ‘limit caffeine’. Avoid using stimulants to ‘offset’ benzo sedation; this increases risk‑taking while still impaired. Source: DrugBank food interactions; general benzo HR consensus.\n• Paradoxical agitation, disinhibition, and anterograde amnesia can occur, especially at higher doses, in children/older adults, or with alcohol. If paradoxical reactions emerge, discontinue and seek medical guidance. Sources: Drugs‑Forum monograph; Erowid benzo pages.",

    "notes": "Diclazepam is a long-acting designer benzodiazepine (Roche code Ro5‑3448) that metabolises to delorazepam, lorazepam and lormetazepam; these active metabolites extend impairment and drug-test detection windows beyond the parent half-life. In serum, parent drug may be detectable to ~4 days and delorazepam up to ~10 days; urine windows can be longer. Do not drive or operate machinery the day after dosing if any residual sedation is felt. Dosing in unregulated markets is highly variable; analytical work found nominal “1 mg” tablets actually contained ~0.59–1.39 mg (median ~0.95 mg). Treat all products as potentially mislabelled and use drug checking when possible. The onset can feel subtle for the first hours; avoid redosing to “chase” effects—accumulation leads to blackouts and risky disinhibition. Combining with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, barbiturates) markedly increases the risk of respiratory depression, loss of consciousness and aspiration; this combination is strongly discouraged. Tramadol with benzodiazepines is flagged as dangerous (sedation, seizure risk); place anyone who becomes unresponsive in the recovery position and call emergency services. Because diclazepam converts to prescribed benzodiazepines, expect positive immunoassay/confirmatory tests for benzos (including lorazepam/delorazepam) for days after use. RC benzodiazepines are frequently mis-sold or cross-contaminated (e.g., bromazolam or norflurazepam in “alprazolam” tablets), underscoring the value of drug checking and cautious test dosing. Avoid abrupt cessation after repeated use; seek medical support for a gradual taper using a longer-acting benzodiazepine if needed. If preparing solutions for accurate low dosing, use a known solvent and concentration (volumetric dosing) and label clearly; never “eyeball” doses. ",

    "notes": "• Phenazepam is a long‑acting benzodiazepine; TripSit’s benzo table lists an approximate 60 h half‑life, meaning effects and impairment can persist into the following days and accumulate with redosing. Plan doses with a multi‑day horizon and avoid daily use. • Relative potency is high: TripSit lists ~1 mg phenazepam ≈ 10 mg diazepam orally. Start at the low end (0.5–1 mg) and reassess after full onset; do not assume diazepam-like margins. • Because it is active at sub‑milligram to low‑milligram levels, eyeballing powder routinely leads to blackouts and multi‑day amnesia; use a 0.001 g scale and volumetric dosing. Numerous community harm‑reduction threads document severe consequences from mismeasurement. • Onset can be slow (up to 1–1.5 h or longer); redosing before the first dose peaks is a frequent cause of overdose and prolonged blackout. Wait several hours before considering any additional dose. • Avoid insufflation and injection: phenazepam is poorly water‑soluble and reports describe unreliable absorption and delayed effects by non‑oral routes, compounding overdose risk. • Polysubstance risk is high: combining benzodiazepines with alcohol, GHB/GBL, opioids, or tramadol markedly increases sedation and respiratory‑depression risk; if someone becomes unresponsive, place them in the recovery position and call emergency services. Do not attempt home reversal. • Counterfeit or mislabelled tablets are common in illicit markets (e.g., “Xanax/Valium” pressed with other benzos); use drug checking where available and be prepared for unexpected strength or different substances. • Benzodiazepine withdrawal can be severe and potentially life‑threatening; do not abruptly stop after extended or high‑dose use. Seek medical support for a gradual taper. (General benzo harm‑reduction guidance.) • Long half‑life plus amnesia increases risk of unsafe behaviors (driving, online purchases, interpersonal conflict) during multi‑day blackouts; secure access to the supply, log dose/time, and enlist a trusted sober person if needed. Community reports repeatedly describe multi‑day blackouts. • Cross‑tolerance with other benzodiazepines is expected; those with existing benzo tolerance may perceive little effect at low doses but still accrue impairment and dependence. • In some regions, benzodiazepines appear in opioid supplies (e.g., bromazolam/nordiazepam found in checked fentanyl samples), increasing overdose risk; test supplies and carry naloxone (note: naloxone does not reverse benzodiazepines).

    "notes": "• N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite, has a mean half-life of ~71–82 hours (longer than parent), causing accumulation, next-day sedation, and prolonged impairment with repeated dosing; effects are markedly higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.\n• Cannabidiol (CBD) significantly increases clobazam exposure (~60%±80%) and increases N-desmethylclobazam by roughly 3–5×, frequently causing excessive sedation; dose reductions and monitoring are recommended when combined.\n• Combining benzodiazepines with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, Z‑drugs, or gabapentinoids greatly elevates risk of respiratory depression, aspiration, blackouts, and death; avoid such combinations. Community HR charts and clinical warnings align on high risk.\n• Alcohol specifically increases clobazam absorption by about 50%, further intensifying CNS depression beyond simple additivity.\n• Stiripentol (for Dravet/LGS adjunct therapy) inhibits CYPs and disproportionately raises norclobazam levels; adverse effects often resolve after reducing clobazam dose.\n• Avoid abrupt discontinuation after regular use; benzodiazepine withdrawal can include seizures. Gradual tapers are recommended; clinical programs commonly use 10–25% dose reductions every 2–3 weeks, individualized to symptoms.\n• December 2023 FDA alert identified rare but severe DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) with clobazam; seek urgent care for rash with fever or systemic symptoms.\n• Next‑day driving and fall risk persist, especially in older adults, those with hepatic/respiratory disease, and with polypharmacy; plan no driving or high‑risk tasks until fully unimpaired.\n• Metabolism: clobazam is mainly N‑demethylated by CYP3A4 (also 2C19/2B6) to N‑desmethylclobazam, which is cleared predominantly by CYP2C19; inhibitors/inducers of these enzymes materially change exposure.\n• Pregnancy and neonatal risk: benzodiazepines cross the placenta and can cause neonatal sedation or withdrawal; both clobazam and its metabolite are present in breast milk — weigh risks/benefits and monitor infants if exposed.

For naïve or sensitive users, do not exceed 0.125 mg initially and allow the full 2 hours to gauge effects before considering any increase. This reduces blackout risk and cumulative sedation.\n• Measurable CNS depression occurs at typical doses; combining with alcohol substantially increases subjective sedation and prolongs/elvates plasma levels versus placebo, raising impairment and overdose risk. Avoid alcohol for the entire night when brotizolam is used.\n• Co-use with opioids (including tramadol and methadone) or other depressants (GHB/GBL, barbiturates, sedating antihistamines) is a leading cause of life-threatening respiratory depression; treat such combos as dangerous.\n• Metabolized primarily via CYP3A pathways; strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, grapefruit) can raise brotizolam exposure; inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin) can reduce effects. If unavoidable, lower doses and extra spacing are prudent.\n• Onset is often ~15–30 minutes with peak around 1 hour; next-morning impairment of reaction time and tracking can persist, especially at higher doses or with alcohol. Do not drive or operate machinery until you feel fully alert the next day.\n• In liver impairment, elimination can be prolonged (reports up to ~13 h). Elderly or debilitated patients should start at 0.125 mg or lower.\n• Tolerance to hypnotic effects can emerge within 1–2 weeks of nightly use; dependence can form with regular use. Limit continuous use to the shortest possible period and avoid unplanned escalations.\n• Do not stop abruptly after repeated use; taper gradually to reduce rebound insomnia, anxiety, and seizure risk.\n• Use pharmaceutical product where possible. If handling non‑RX powders or liquids, employ calibrated scales and consider volumetric dosing for sub‑milligram accuracy to prevent accidental overdosing.\n• Contraindications parallel benzodiazepines: severe respiratory disease, significant hepatic dysfunction, pregnancy/lactation, and narrow‑angle glaucoma warrant avoidance unless directed by a clinician.

Avoid co-use and beware delayed toxicity if alcohol was consumed earlier in the day.\n- Fentanyl and other potent opioids have been repeatedly detected in white powders sold as cocaine in some regions; this has caused clusters of opioid overdoses among stimulant users. Never assume stimulant-only; avoid mixing with opioids, carry naloxone where legal, and test if drug checking is available.\n- Levamisole, phenacetin, local anesthetics (lidocaine/procaine/benzocaine), and caffeine are common adulterants. Levamisole can cause agranulocytosis and vasculitis; seek medical care for fevers, mouth sores, or skin lesions. Drug checking services frequently report these cuts.\n- Snorting care: finely crush, use your own clean straw or single-use tool, rinse with sterile/saline water before and after, rotate nostrils, and take breaks to reduce septal damage and infections, including BBV transmission via microbleeds. Avoid banknotes.\n- High cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, hypertension, vasospasm) and overheating are key acute risks. Avoid strenuous activity/overheating, especially during binges; seek urgent care for chest pain, severe headache, confusion, or hyperthermia. Clinical guidance emphasizes external cooling and supportive care for toxicity.\n- Beta-blockers: do not self-medicate. The old warning about “unopposed alpha” is debated; mixed alpha/beta agents (e.g., labetalol) are used in clinical settings, but nonselective beta-blockers can be problematic. If prescribed beta-blockers, discuss stimulant use with a clinician.\n- Serotonergic medicines (SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, MAOIs) can increase risk of serotonin toxicity; MAOIs are particularly hazardous with stimulants. Treat all serotonergic combinations as higher risk and avoid MAOIs entirely.\n- IV use markedly increases risk of arrhythmia, infection, and overdose. If injecting, sterile equipment, sterile water, skin cleaning, and safe disposal are essential; consider alternative routes to reduce harm.\n- Smoking applies to crack/freebase only; use proper glass stems and heat-resistant screens to reduce burns and inhalation of toxic plastics. Avoid plastic pens/foil. HR orgs advise dedicated safer-smoking equipment.\n- Sleep loss and repeated redosing amplify anxiety/paranoia and crash severity. Plan limits for dose/stop time, hydrate with modest fluids and electrolytes, eat light food, and schedule recovery sleep.\n- Pregnancy/breastfeeding: cocaine passes into breast milk and has caused infant toxicity; complete avoidance is advised.\n- Mixing with ketamine is increasingly reported in nightlife settings; the combination can complicate emergencies and adds cardiovascular and dissociative risks—treat as unsafe.

    "notes": "Chlordiazepoxide has a long elimination time and produces active metabolites (including desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam), so effects and impairment can persist into the next day—avoid redosing and plan for extended sedation. Its CNS depressant effects are synergistic with alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, gabapentinoids, first-generation antihistamines, and other sedatives, markedly increasing the risk of respiratory depression and overdose. Because of slow onset (30–60 min) and prolonged peaks (1–4 h), impatience-driven redosing is a common error—wait several hours before judging effect. Driving and safety-sensitive tasks can be impaired for 12–24+ hours; next‑day effects are common at higher doses or with repeated dosing. Tolerance to sedative/anxiolytic effects emerges quickly with regular use; dependence can develop within weeks, so courses should be short and dose minimal. Abrupt cessation after regular use can precipitate severe withdrawal (including seizures); any taper should be gradual and medically supervised. In older adults and in hepatic impairment, accumulation is more likely and sedation/fall risk is higher—use extra caution and lower doses. Do not crush tablets to inject or plug—binders/fillers and poor water solubility create serious vascular risks and unpredictable absorption. Rough oral equivalence is ~25 mg chlordiazepoxide ≈ 10 mg diazepam; interindividual variability means equivalence is only a guide and not a dosing instruction. For people using other depressants (e.g., opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, gabapentinoids), avoid concomitant use; if exposure has occurred, reduce doses drastically, do not use alone, and ensure monitoring.",

Delayed onset (often ≥60 minutes) increases redose temptation; plan a fixed single dose and wait. Strong sedation, psychomotor impairment, anterograde amnesia, and next-day ‘hangover’ are commonly reported—do not drive, cycle, swim, or operate machinery for at least 24 hours after dosing (longer after high doses). Combining with other depressants—especially opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL or tramadol—markedly increases risk of respiratory depression and fatal overdose; avoid these combinations. If physically dependent, do not abruptly stop: benzodiazepine withdrawal can be severe or life-threatening; taper gradually with clinical guidance. Avoid insufflation or injection: poor solubility and binders increase harm with no benefit; if using powder, prepare a measured solution (e.g., in propylene glycol/ethanol) for volumetric dosing to improve accuracy. Consider pregnancy and neonatal risks: benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may cause neonatal withdrawal; seek medical advice. Given frequent counterfeit/overdosed tablets in the market, prefer known-concentration solutions and send suspect samples to a lab drug-checking service when feasible.",

    "notes": "• Urinary pH strongly controls amphetamine clearance: acidic urine shortens the half‑life and alkaline urine can extend it into the 20–30+ hour range; antacids and bicarbonate can therefore increase exposure unpredictably. Avoid intentional pH manipulation for dosing. • Amphetamine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6; potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, ritonavir) can raise blood levels and side‑effects—dose cautiously and avoid stacking with such inhibitors. • Combining with MAOIs is dangerous (hypertensive crisis/serotonin toxicity); observe a minimum 14‑day washout. • Intranasal use damages nasal mucosa over time; to reduce harm, finely powder, use small, spaced lines, alternate nostrils, and rinse with sterile saline afterward. Persistent bleeding/crusting warrants a break. • Stimulant use increases heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature; hot environments, intense exercise, or prolonged dancing further raise hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis risk—take cool breaks, avoid overheating, and sip fluids regularly without overhydrating. • Redosing to chase euphoria rapidly elevates plasma levels due to the long half‑life, worsening anxiety, insomnia, and psychosis risk while providing diminishing returns; set a session cut‑off and prioritize sleep and nutrition. • Antihypertensives may work less effectively during stimulant use; those with cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension should avoid nonmedical use. • Test unknown powders and avoid mixed batches: street “speed” may contain other stimulants or contaminants; use drug‑checking services where available. • Mixing with DXM, tramadol, or triptans increases serotonin‑toxicity risk; know early symptoms (agitation, clonus, hyperthermia) and seek urgent care if they appear. • Sleep deprivation itself can precipitate stimulant psychosis; spacing use by weeks and keeping doses modest lowers this risk.

    "notes": "Reasoning and evidence for harm-reduction additions (with sources):\n- Prodrug to GHB: Aceburic acid is the acetate ester at 4‑OH of GHB, expected to be rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to active GHB. Community chemists have long noted this, explicitly calling it “4‑acetoxy‑GHB… metabolised pretty rapidly by esterases into GHB.” This supports treating dosing, interactions, and risks as GHB‑like.\n- Steep dose–response and tight redose window: GHB has a very steep curve; TripSit warns even small overdoses can progress from euphoria to unrousable sleep/coma. Therefore, space redoses by at least 2 hours and avoid stacking. This is crucial because aceburic’s slightly delayed onset versus GBL increases premature redose risk.\n- Accurate measurement: Liquids/powders should be measured with a precise scale or known‑concentration solution; poor measurement is a leading cause of G‑outs. Drugs‑Forum and Erowid emphasize accurate dosing and variability of liquids; do not swig from containers.\n- Avoid depressant mixing: Alcohol, benzos, opioids, barbiturates markedly increase risk of respiratory depression, vomiting, and aspiration. TripSit lists these combinations as unsafe; SaferParty repeatedly warns of life‑threatening additive CNS/respiratory depression with GHB/GBL plus depressants.\n- Stimulants caution: Uppers can mask sedation, leading to risk‑taking, mis‑timed redosing, and cardiovascular strain. SaferParty highlights this general risk with downer–upper mixes.\n- Overdose management: There is no specific antidote; management is supportive with airway protection. Community HR stresses recovery position to reduce aspiration risk and to monitor breathing until help arrives. Do not give stimulants or more substances. Public‑domain reviews of GHB toxicity also emphasize supportive care and respiratory monitoring.\n- Onset/kinetics framing: Compared with GHB salts, prodrugs like GBL have faster onset; aceburic appears intermediate (slower than GBL, near GHB). TripSit’s GHB timings (10–40 min onset, 1–3 h total) and the clinical review of GHB PK/PD justify conservative timing and spacing recommendations for the ester.\n- Mucosal/GI irritation and pH: Acidic or strongly basic G‑related solutions can burn mucosa. Users and moderators on Bluelight report oral and cheek burns when solutions are not properly neutralized. For aceburic acid, dissolving and buffering to near‑neutral pH with food‑grade carbonate reduces throat irritation and likely discourages corrosive injury.\n- Dependence & withdrawal risk: GHB dependence can develop rapidly with around‑the‑clock use; withdrawal can be severe and requires medical care (often benzodiazepines as first‑line). The clinical review and Drugs‑Forum resources document this. Set hard frequency limits (e.g., max 2–3 uses/week) to minimize risk.\n- Legal risk context: EUDA reports GHB/GBL as depressants of concern; many jurisdictions control GHB and often its prodrugs/precursors. As an ester of a scheduled drug, aceburic may be considered controlled; check local law.\n- Practical HR tips: Use timers (phone/app) to enforce redose spacing; community tools exist for G tracking. Keep a sober sitter, avoid driving for at least 6 hours after last strong dose, and lock up supply to prevent accidental ingestion.\n\nConcise HR guidance:\n- Treat aceburic doses cautiously as GHB‑equivalent after accounting for mass; start low, wait full onset. Use a 0.01 g scale or standardized solution; never drink from stocks. Keep redose spacing ≥2 h. Avoid all depressant mixes. If someone is unrousable, place in recovery position, monitor breathing, call emergency if apnea/bradycardia occur. Buffer acidic solutions to ~pH 7 to lower throat irritation. Frequent/round‑the‑clock use can cause severe dependence; seek medical help to taper. Because legal status is unclear, possession may carry risk.",

    "notes": "DOM has a slow onset and an extremely long duration; this historically led to non-fatal overdoses in the late 1960s when strong tablets were redosed prematurely. Redosing is discouraged, as intensity can increase significantly several hours after ingestion. Cardiovascular stimulation and peripheral vasoconstriction are commonly reported with DOx compounds; avoid combining with other stimulants or vasoconstrictors and avoid strenuous activity or hot environments; stay cool and sip fluids regularly. Lithium has repeatedly been associated with seizures and severe adverse reactions when combined with serotonergic psychedelics (e.g., LSD); by extension treat DOM + lithium as a dangerous combination. Metabolism involves CYP2D6; potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) may increase exposure, and DOM/related DOx can themselves inhibit CYP2D6—be cautious with co-medications that rely on this pathway. Immunoassay urine screens may return class-positive for ‘amphetamines’ with substituted amphetamines; targeted confirmation (e.g., GC/MS) can detect hydroxy-DOM and other metabolites, and detection windows vary—do not rely on specific ‘one week’ claims. Because DOM is potent at low milligram doses, use a 1 mg-accurate scale or volumetric dosing to reduce dosing error; avoid insufflation due to prolonged vasoconstriction and unpredictable intensity. Be prepared for insomnia during and after the experience; plan 24–36 hours of downtime. Where available, use reagent testing and consider lab drug checking; be aware that DOx has been sold on blotter or as other psychedelics—always wait at least 3 hours before making any dosing decisions.",

Redosing: EMCDDA notes 2C‑I can have a slower onset than expected, which has led some users to prematurely redose or add other drugs; wait at least 2 hours after an oral dose before considering any change. Intranasal risks: snorting 2C‑x (including 2C‑I) is frequently reported as extremely painful and more likely to cause nausea, vomiting, and a harsh stimulant edge; many experienced users avoid the route—if used, reduce dose markedly and expect severe nasal irritation. Cardiovascular strain: phenomenology and receptor data (5‑HT2A/2C and potential alpha‑1 adrenergic action) imply vasoconstriction, mild tachycardia and blood‑pressure elevation; those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or migraine susceptibility should avoid use and all users should minimize exertion/overheating. Serotonergic/seizure‑threshold cautions: avoid combinations with MAOIs entirely and with tramadol due to seizure and serotonin‑toxicity risks; SSRIs/SNRIs may blunt effects and complicate response. Lithium is specifically flagged as dangerous with classical serotonergic psychedelics due to seizure risk; do not combine. Set and setting: stimulation can amplify anxiety—use with a trusted sober sitter in a calm environment; avoid crowded, hot venues on first trials. Hydration and temperature: sip water periodically (not excessively) and take cool breaks if active; overheating increases risk with stimulating psychedelics. Dosing discipline: always allergy test with a very small amount (e.g., 1–3 mg oral), then titrate across separate sessions using a 0.001 g scale; never eyeball. Sleep and after‑effects: residual stimulation can impair sleep into the next day; plan recovery time and do not drive or operate machinery for at least 12–24 hours after significant effects resolve. Legal and substitution risk: 2C‑I is Schedule I in the U.S. and controlled in many countries; the market has historically included mislabeling (including NBOMe and DOx) so reagent test each sample.",

    "notes": "DOB is a potent, long-acting psychedelic amphetamine with active doses in the low milligram range; accurate milligram measurement or volumetric dosing is essential to reduce overdose risk. The onset is slow (often 1–3 hours), so redosing too early is a common error—waiting at least 3–4 hours before any redose materially lowers the chance of an overly strong experience. Severe peripheral vasoconstriction is a known toxicity at high doses; a published JAMA case linked DOB ingestion to diffuse arterial spasm requiring vasodilator treatment—seek urgent care if extremities become cold, numb, discolored, or intensely painful. Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, hypertension) is common; those with vascular disease, Raynaud’s, hypertension, or cardiac risk should avoid DOB or take extra caution. Because DOB is sometimes found on blotters or mis-sold as LSD/other psychedelics, drug checking is strongly advised; when identity is uncertain, take a partial dose and wait several hours because some adulterants (including DOx) have much later onsets than LSD. The duration (often 18–30 hours) and residual stimulation can disrupt sleep into the next day; plan set/setting, obligations, and hydration/nutrition accordingly. Avoid combinations with other stimulants or vasoconstrictors (e.g., decongestants) to reduce additive blood pressure/vasospasm risks. Lithium coadministration with classical psychedelics has been repeatedly cautioned against in harm-reduction charts due to seizure risk; this combination should be avoided. MAOI co-use is high risk because DOB is serotonergic and stimulating; hypertensive crises or serotonin toxicity are possible even at typical doses. Alcohol may mask coming-up anxiety but can worsen dehydration and blood pressure; given the long duration, postponing alcohol until well after the peak (or avoiding it) improves safety. Given variance in street samples, start with a light dose even if prior experiences felt manageable; inter-batch potency and individual sensitivity can differ. If severe agitation, chest pain, or signs of limb ischemia occur, do not delay seeking medical care and disclose suspected DOB/‘DOx’ use so clinicians can monitor and manage vasospasm effectively.",

Treat any exposure as a medical emergency. Carfentanil has been detected as an adulterant or substitute for other opioids (e.g., heroin) and can appear in mixed drug supplies; users are often unaware of exposure. Overdose is characterized by rapid and profound respiratory depression, bradycardia, and loss of consciousness; naloxone can reverse opioid toxicity, but compared with heroin, fentanyl‑class overdoses may require faster administration, more rapid escalation, and overall higher or repeated doses of naloxone, with prolonged observation due to recurrent depression. Drug checking resources report that fentanyl test strips (FTS) can detect many fentanyl analogs, including carfentanil, but false negatives/positives are possible; pairing with confirmatory testing and careful sampling across a solution increases detection chances. Do not rely on a single negative result to assume safety. Polysubstance use—especially with benzodiazepines, alcohol, barbiturates, or gabapentinoids—markedly increases the risk of fatal respiratory depression and complicates reversal (naloxone does not reverse non‑opioid sedatives). Because of carfentanil’s potency and risk of recurrent toxicity, bystanders should call emergency services immediately, administer naloxone promptly (repeat if no response in 2–3 minutes), and provide rescue breathing until professionals take over. Expect need for multiple naloxone doses in some cases. Carfentanil presence in local markets is highly variable; relying on lab‑based drug checking programs (e.g., GC/MS) provides more definitive identification than immunoassay strips alone. ",

    "notes": "Flutoprazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine; its primary active metabolite is norflurazepam (a.k.a. desalkylflurazepam), which has a long half-life and contributes to prolonged sedation and accumulation. This greatly increases next-day impairment and the risk that redosing will lead to blackouts. Driving or operating machinery can remain unsafe for 24–48+ hours after dosing, particularly with repeated use. Combining flutoprazepam with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, or other depressants markedly raises overdose risk through additive/synergistic respiratory and CNS depression; naloxone will reverse opioid effects but not benzodiazepine sedation, so mixed overdoses may only be partially reversed. Long-acting benzodiazepines commonly appear in drug checking of the unregulated opioid supply (e.g., benzo-dope), which complicates overdose response and recovery; test your supply when possible and assume sedation may outlast the opioid. Tolerance to benzodiazepines can develop within days to weeks of regular use, while reversal of tolerance can take weeks; avoid daily use and space sessions by multiple days to reduce escalation. Abrupt cessation after frequent use can precipitate a dangerous withdrawal (including seizures); if dependent, taper gradually with medical supervision rather than stopping suddenly. Elderly individuals and those with pulmonary disease or sleep apnea are at increased risk of falls, confusion, and respiratory depression with long-acting benzodiazepines. Avoid using stimulants to counter sedation: this does not restore coordination/judgment and increases the likelihood of risky redosing. Because active duration is very long, single-dose trials should be small and well-spaced (e.g., at least 72 hours) before considering any redose. If using powders or liquids of uncertain strength, employ volumetric dosing to improve accuracy; in an unregulated market, consider drug checking services to verify identity and dose.",

    "notes": "Dietary tyramine restriction is essential on phenelzine because irreversible MAO‑A/MAO‑B inhibition allows gut tyramine to trigger massive norepinephrine release; even 10–25 mg dietary tyramine has caused severe headache and hypertensive crisis in susceptible patients. Carry a current MAOI warning card/medical ID and tell every prescriber, dentist, and anesthetist in advance; peri‑operative teams often adjust sympathomimetic doses and avoid serotonergic agents. Do NOT combine with serotonergic drugs or OTC cold/flu products (DXM, chlorpheniramine/brompheniramine, phenylephrine/pseudoephedrine) due to risks of serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. Recognize hypertensive crisis: sudden severe occipital or throbbing headache, neck stiffness, chest pain, palpitations, profuse sweating, pallor/flushing, nausea/vomiting, vision changes, or marked BP elevation—treat as an emergency and explicitly state “on an MAOI” to responders. Recognize serotonin toxicity: agitation/confusion, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia/clonus, tremor, diarrhea, fever, fluctuating BP/HR—seek urgent care and stop serotonergic exposures. Washouts matter because MAO inhibition persists until new enzyme is synthesized: allow at least 14 days after stopping phenelzine before starting other serotonergic/adrenergic agents; allow longer after fluoxetine before starting phenelzine (commonly 5–6 weeks minimum). Limit caffeine—MAOIs can potentiate pressor effects; keep intake consistent and modest and avoid large bolus doses. Alcohol: avoid tyramine‑rich forms (tap/draught beers, some craft/aged beers, red wine); if any alcohol is consumed, choose low‑tyramine spirits in small amounts and never with other contraindicated agents. Orthostatic hypotension is common—rise slowly, hydrate regularly, and discuss salt/fluid strategies or compression garments with a clinician if symptomatic. Hepatotoxicity, although uncommon, is documented: obtain baseline and periodic liver function tests; discontinue and seek evaluation for dark urine, jaundice, pruritus, unexplained fatigue, or right‑upper‑quadrant pain. Hydrazine MAOIs (phenelzine, isocarboxazid) can deplete vitamin B6 via hydrazone formation; clinicians sometimes supplement pyridoxine (B6) rather than pyridoxal forms—discuss with your prescriber. For dental/local anesthesia, inform the provider; epinephrine‑containing solutions and indirect‑acting sympathomimetics may have exaggerated effects; avoid serotonergic peri‑operative drugs (e.g., meperidine, tramadol, large/repeated fentanyl, ondansetron, metoclopramide). Never combine phenelzine with MDMA, 2C‑x/DOx/NBOMe phenethylamines, or tryptamines; reports and HR consensus consider these combinations high‑risk for life‑threatening events. If switching therapies, coordinate with a specialist; faster washouts or cross‑tapers are hazardous with irreversible MAOIs.",

    "notes": "— Pharmacology: In vitro profiling shows 2‑aminoindane acts as a monoamine transporter substrate with higher potency at NET and DAT than at SERT, and it binds α2‑adrenergic receptors at low‑to‑mid‑nanomolar Ki, consistent with reports of peripheral vasoconstriction, piloerection and mild analgesia. This profile distinguishes it from serotonergic aminoindanes such as MDAI. — Dose uncertainty: Formal human dose‑finding data are lacking; community reports vary widely, from inactive at 10–20 mg oral to clear stimulation at 50–100+ mg, with rectal administration increasing intensity. Start low, especially with new batches. — Duration and redosing: The active phase is short, but residual stimulation can prolong into insomnia; repeated redoses compress sleep and may precipitate anxiety or paranoid thoughts. Build a clear ‘no‑redose after X hours’ rule before starting. — Cardiovascular risk: Expect elevations in BP/HR; those with hypertension, arrhythmia, or other cardiovascular disease should avoid. Seek urgent care for chest pain, severe headache, confusion, or temperature >38.5 °C. — ROA risks: Intranasal use is notably painful and damaging to mucosa; use isotonic saline rinses if mistakenly insufflated. Rectal use should employ sterile water, body‑temperature isotonic solution and clean syringes (no needles), and precise volumetric dosing; avoid if there is rectal bleeding or inflammation. — Comedown/sleep: Prefer non‑pharmacologic sleep hygiene first (dark room, magnesium glycinate, hydration). If a sedative is used, avoid alcohol co‑use and do not stack multiple depressants. — Drug checking: Aminoindanes/NPS are frequently mis‑sold; confirm identity with multi‑reagent testing and, ideally, lab analysis (GC/MS/FTIR). Reagent color reactions for 2‑AI are inconsistent across batches; treat color tests as presumptive only. — Tolerance: Acute tolerance rises quickly during a session and decays over about a week; spacing sessions ≥7 days is prudent.",

Mis‑selling has been documented by drug checking services (e.g., 4F‑MPH sold as 4‑FA and mixed with caffeine/MDMA), so check samples where possible and always start with an allergy dose. Oral use is generally lower‑risk for nasal tissue than insufflation; if insufflating, use small, well‑spaced bumps, rotate nostrils, and use sterile saline to reduce damage. Because active dosing is in the single‑milligram range for many users, a 0.001 g scale and preferably volumetric dosing are strongly recommended to avoid overshooting. Allow at least 2 hours after an oral dose before considering any redose; creeping effects and long tails make premature redosing a common pitfall. Expect pronounced vasoconstriction in some users (cold extremities, tingling); escalating doses to overcome this can worsen cardiovascular strain without adding desired effects. Sleep debt dramatically increases psychiatric risks (paranoia, anxiety, dysphoria); set a hard cutoff time and plan sleep hygiene. People with hypertension, arrhythmia, or other cardiovascular disease should avoid 4F‑MPH; if chest pain, severe headache, or palpitations occur, stop and seek medical advice. Avoid combining with MDMA or other stimulants due to additive heart‑rate/BP and overheating risks; if on antidepressants, avoid poly‑serotonergic stacks and monitor for agitation, tremor, sweating, or clonus. Harm‑reduction essentials: reagent/lab test where available; keep hydration modest and electrolytes balanced; avoid alcohol; do not drive; and do not eyeball doses.",

    "notes": "Hydromorphone is ~5–7× as potent as morphine; small dosing errors—especially by IV or in non‑tolerant users—can cause fatal respiratory depression. Co‑use with other CNS depressants (benzodiazepines, alcohol, GHB/GBL, Z‑drugs) markedly increases overdose risk due to additive/synergistic respiratory depression; avoid these combinations and keep naloxone on hand. Intranasal bioavailability clusters around ~50–60%, while oral figures vary widely (~30–60% across sources), so insufflated doses should usually be lower than oral for comparable effect. Extended‑release (ER/CR) tablets contain tamper‑resistant polymers; crushing/heating/injecting them can cause gelled clots, pulmonary emboli, and dose dumping—do not inject ER/CR products. If people inject diverted tablets despite risks, use sterile water, new equipment every time, and a 0.22 µm micron filter to remove insoluble binders; never share or reuse syringes to reduce BBV risks (HIV/HCV). In unregulated markets, counterfeit ‘Dilaudid’/opioid tablets may contain fentanyl, nitazenes, benzos, or xylazine; consider drug checking and treat unknown pills as very potent—start with a tiny ‘allergy’ dose and use fentanyl test strips when available. Renal impairment increases risk of accumulation of hydromorphone metabolites (e.g., H3G) that are associated with neuroexcitatory effects; reduce exposure and seek medical advice if kidney function is reduced. Compared with morphine, hydromorphone tends to cause less histamine‑mediated pruritus, but constipation, nausea, and drowsiness are common; hydrate and consider a bowel regimen if used repeatedly. After a period of abstinence (e.g., detox, jail, illness), tolerance drops quickly and ‘usual’ doses can become lethal—restart at a fraction of prior dose. Carry naloxone and train peers: give 1–4 mg IN or 0.4–2 mg IM/IV, repeat every 2–3 minutes if no response, provide rescue breathing and place in recovery position while waiting for EMS; multiple doses may be needed with potent adulterants. Avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least several hours after dosing; residual impairment may outlast euphoria. Rotating between opioids requires caution due to incomplete cross‑tolerance; when changing substances or routes, reduce expected equivalent doses and titrate slowly.",

    "notes": "Dimenhydrinate is a salt that dissociates into diphenhydramine (anticholinergic H1 antihistamine) and 8‑chlorotheophylline (a methylxanthine with adenosine receptor blockade), which can both shape effects and side‑effects. At high doses, users can develop a full anticholinergic toxidrome: agitation, confusion, hallucinations, mydriasis, dry skin/mucosa, urinary retention, hyperthermia, tachycardia, decreased bowel sounds. Onset and peak can be slow (up to ~2–3 hours); redosing early risks stacking and unexpectedly severe delirium. Avoid heat, strenuous activity, or hot environments while intoxicated due to impaired sweating and hyperthermia risk. Do not drive or operate machinery for the rest of the day and potentially the next morning because impairing sedation and vestibular effects may persist beyond the perceived ‘trip.’ People with glaucoma, urinary retention/BPH, or significant pulmonary disease should avoid use without medical supervision due to anticholinergic effects exacerbating these conditions. Children and older adults are more susceptible to delirium, paradoxical excitation, seizures, and serious toxicity; keep products locked away and never use recreationally in these groups. Dimenhydrinate has been associated with QTc prolongation and conduction disturbances at high exposure (largely via diphenhydramine), so avoid combining with other QT‑prolonging drugs and seek care if syncope or palpitations occur. Seizures are a recognized complication of antihistamine toxicity; avoid co‑ingesting agents that lower seizure threshold and seek urgent care if tremor, clonus, or seizure activity appears. If signs of anticholinergic toxicity emerge (confusion, inability to sweat, very hot skin, urinary retention, visual disturbances), seek emergency help; in hospital, benzodiazepines and temperature control are first‑line, and physostigmine may be considered by clinicians for severe pure anticholinergic delirium. Verify the active ingredient on any ‘motion‑sickness’ or ‘original/less drowsy’ products; similarly named brand variants in different markets may contain different actives. Because each 100 mg of dimenhydrinate contains only about 53–55.5 mg of diphenhydramine base, very large ‘recreational’ dimenhydrinate doses can covertly correspond to high diphenhydramine exposure and its cardiotoxic/deliriant risks.",

    "notes": "- Dextroamphetamine is metabolized by CYP2D6; strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, quinidine) can increase plasma levels and side‑effects; start low and avoid stacking with multiple inhibitors. Evidence: DrugBank metabolism section; StatPearls warns that co‑use with CYP2D6 inhibitors elevates serotonin‑toxicity risk.\n- Co‑administration with MAOIs is contraindicated and requires a minimum 14‑day washout to avoid hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. This applies to classical MAOIs and agents with MAOI activity (linezolid, methylene blue).\n- Serotonergic combinations (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, tramadol, dextromethorphan, triptans) increase serotonin‑toxicity risk; seek medical care for agitation, tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, hyperthermia.\n- Urinary and GI pH strongly influence exposure: alkaline urine slows elimination and increases half‑life; acidic urine accelerates clearance. Acidic fruit juices can also reduce GI absorption; conversely, antacids/alkalinizers may increase exposure. Plan dosing and timing accordingly and avoid deliberate alkalinization to “potentiate.”\n- Cardiovascular risks rise with dose, redosing, dehydration, and co‑stimulants (e.g., caffeine, decongestants). Screen for personal/family cardiac disease and stop use if chest pain, syncope, or sustained tachycardia occur.\n- Heat stress and overexertion can precipitate hyperthermia; avoid heavy exercise and hot environments during peak effects; maintain moderate hydration with electrolytes, but do not over‑hydrate.\n- Compulsive redosing is a recognized pattern with stimulants; pre‑measure doses, keep reserves out of reach, and plan a hard stop time to reduce binge risk.\n- Expect common acute effects like appetite suppression, insomnia, anxiety/irritability, bruxism, dry mouth, tachycardia, and increased BP; jaw protection (sugar‑free gum) and oral hygiene help mitigate bruxism/dry mouth.\n- High or repeated doses raise risks of paranoid ideation and psychosis; sleep, nutrition, and multi‑day breaks markedly reduce this risk. Seek medical attention for persistent hallucinations, severe agitation, or suicidality.\n- Difficulty urinating and peripheral vasoconstriction (cold fingers/toes) can occur; take bathroom breaks and keep warm; seek care if painful retention or severe pallor/paresthesia occurs.\n- Extended‑release capsules/patches are designed for slow delivery; tampering (crushing, chewing, extracting) defeats the mechanism and may cause overdose. Treat transdermal patch disposal carefully to prevent diversion. (General HR; product forms listed on DrugBank.)\n- Nutrition: plan balanced meals around use days and refeed on comedown; stimulants can suppress appetite and, over time, contribute to weight loss and low immunity.

Human pharmacokinetics are not established; user timelines suggest a 4–8 h primary effect window with residual stimulation and insomnia into the next day. Marked batch-to-batch potency variability has been reported; always allergy test (1–2 mg), use a milligram scale, and titrate slowly. Redosing can escalate cardiovascular strain and insomnia; set a hard cap and avoid extended binges (>24 h) due to psychosis/seizure risk. Stimulant risks include hypertension, tachycardia, vasoconstriction (cold extremities), hyperthermia, and dehydration; actively manage temperature and electrolytes, especially during dancing/exertion. Avoid combinations that raise serotonin (e.g., DXM, tramadol, MDMA) or lower seizure threshold (e.g., bupropion); MAOIs are a hard contraindication. Use drug checking: vendors sometimes mislabel ring-substituted amphetamines/cathinones; multi-reagent testing and, where available, spectrometric checking reduce adulterant risks. Nasal use increases local tissue irritation and infection risk; use clean equipment and isotonic saline rinses post-session. People with cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or a history of psychosis should avoid use; anyone on prescription psych meds should consider interaction risks and spacing. Space sessions by at least 1–2 weeks to allow tolerance and sleep patterns to normalize; prioritize nutrition (carbohydrates, protein) and rehydration after use.

PMA is frequently mis-sold as MDMA in pressed pills or powders, but it has slower onset (often >60 minutes) and less euphoria, prompting risky redosing that has been implicated in clusters of fatalities. Expect marked hyperthermia and hypertension risk; avoid hot environments, prolonged dancing, and strenuous activity. If effects are unexpectedly delayed or atypical for MDMA, do not redose and seek a cool, quiet space. Hydrate with small sips of isotonic fluids (~300 mL/hour) and avoid overhydration. Reagent testing: PMA typically shows no reaction with Marquis/Mecke; PMMA may show a blue Simon’s reaction without MDMA-like Marquis/Mecke changes. Absence of the expected MDMA reaction is a red flag—only lab drug checking (e.g., GC/MS) can confirm composition. Strongly avoid combinations with serotonergic agents (SSRIs, MAOIs, tramadol, dextromethorphan, triptans) and with other stimulants or MDMA, due to serotonin syndrome and hyperthermia risk. Seek emergency help for high temperature, confusion/agitation, severe headache, chest pain, or persistent vomiting. Given its poor safety profile and repeated association with deaths, routine recreational use is not advised.",

Equipment or cutting errors have caused blackouts and unintentional overdoses; volumetric dosing and a calibrated scale (0.001 g readability) are harm‑reduction best practices.\n• Strong amnesia/blackout risk: many reports describe anterograde amnesia with disinhibition. Avoid redosing during the first 2 hours; set timers and keep a written log of each dose to reduce binge/blackout risk.\n• Combining with depressants greatly increases overdose risk via additive respiratory/CNS depression. The highest‑risk mixes are with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, gabapentinoids, and dissociatives.\n• Counterfeit/unknown tablets are common: many “benzo” pills contain unexpected substances (other potent benzos, antihistamines, or even opioids). Whenever possible, use a trusted drug‑checking service; assume mislabeling risk in unregulated markets.\n• Next‑day impairment is possible even at low doses; do not drive or operate machinery until fully sober. Residual effects may last into the next day.\n• Dependence and withdrawal: benzodiazepine withdrawal can be severe and potentially life‑threatening (seizures). Do not stop abruptly after repeated use; medical supervision and gradual tapering are advised.\n• Avoid injecting or snorting: most benzos and tablet fillers have poor aqueous solubility; crushing tablets for solutions risks vein damage and emboli.\n• Overdose management: flumazenil is a hospital‑use antidote; unsupervised use can precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in dependent polydrug users—seek emergency care instead of attempting layperson reversal.\n• High variability across batches/vendors has been noted for designer benzos; treat each new batch cautiously and test a low dose first (“allergy test”), waiting full onset.\n• Keep access to additional doses limited (pre‑measured only), secure sharp objects/valuables, and avoid online shopping or driving while under the influence to mitigate blackout‑related harms.

    "notes": "Reasoned additions and changes (with sources):\n- Limited formal data: There is no robust, peer‑reviewed human pharmacokinetic or clinical safety literature specific to 4‑FEA as of November 6, 2025; most knowledge comes from user reports and by-analogy with 4‑FA. Therefore, conservative dosing, single‑substance trials, and avoidance of polydrug combinations are prudent. (General inference; see 4‑FA summaries and community reports.)\n- Cardiovascular/neurological risks by analogy with 4‑FA: 4‑FA’s popularity in the Netherlands was followed by warnings and policy action citing strokes, brain haemorrhage, severe headaches, and cardiac issues. Given structural and effect overlap, 4‑FEA users should treat severe headache, chest pain, or neurological deficits as medical emergencies. (Analogy from 4‑FA alerts.)\n- Hydration/temperature: As with MDMA-like entactogens, overheating and dehydration are key hazards at parties; use MDMA harm‑reduction hydration guidance (roughly 250 ml/h resting and up to 500 ml/h dancing, plus cooling breaks) as a cautious proxy, while avoiding overhydration. (Proxy guidance from MDMA HR.)\n- Serotonergic interactions: Combining serotonergic agents (e.g., MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM) increases serotonin syndrome and/or seizure risk; this is well‑documented for MDMA and tramadol and generalizes to serotonergic amphetamines. (Use MDMA/tramadol interaction documentation as a conservative template.)\n- Redosing/spacing: Strongly limit redosing; leave weeks to months between sessions to allow monoamine recovery (MDMA best‑practice suggests 1–3 months). Users report that 4‑FEA can feel sedating or confusing at higher doses rather than more euphoric. (Proxy spacing rule from MDMA HR; user reports for sedation/confusion.)\n- Route of administration: Oral is generally preferred. Users frequently report that insufflation increases peripheral side‑effects with less empathogenic payoff; some moderators caution that vaporizing halogenated amphetamines is questionable. (Community harm‑reduction.)\n- Individual variability: Reports range from MDMA‑like euphoria at 120–200 mg oral to dysphoria/sedation even at higher doses; this variability underscores the need for allergy testing (e.g., 1–2 mg) and very slow titration. (Community reports.)\n- Urinary retention and jaw clenching are commonly mentioned; magnesium may subjectively help bruxism for some with MDMA, but evidence is limited—avoid excessive supplementation and prioritize rest and hydration. (User reports and general HR; avoid high-dose supplements.)\nAugmented guidance incorporated accordingly below.",

    "notes": "• Tramadol lowers seizure threshold; risk rises with higher single doses (>250–300 mg), rapid redosing, co-use of stimulants or other seizure‑threshold–lowering medicines (e.g., bupropion, many antidepressants), history of seizures, or electrolyte abnormalities. Seizures have occurred even within the therapeutic range in susceptible people. • Time-to-peak is slow (3–4 h). Redosing early to “chase” effects substantially increases overdose and seizure risk; wait through the peak before deciding about any redose. • Tramadol is a μ‑opioid agonist and a serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; combining with serotonergic agents (SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs/triptans/MDMA/DXM/MAOIs) can precipitate serotonin syndrome (agitation, sweating, tremor/clonus, hyperreflexia, hyperthermia). Seek urgent care if symptoms appear. • Genetic differences matter: CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers produce more M1 (O‑desmethyltramadol) and face greater risk of opioid toxicity/respiratory depression at standard doses; poor metabolizers may get weaker analgesia but relatively more SNRI‑type adverse effects. • CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, quinidine) raise parent‑drug levels and lower M1, shifting effects toward SNRI toxicity and seizures; monitor closely or avoid. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers can also alter exposure; carbamazepine induction can blunt effects and is not recommended with tramadol due to seizure concerns. • Avoid combining with CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines/Z‑drugs, GHB) and/or other opioids—these combinations are strongly associated with fatal respiratory depression and require naloxone availability if use occurs. • Do not inject or snort tablets/capsules: non‑sterile excipients can cause abscesses, vascular injury, and emboli; bypassing first‑pass metabolism unpredictably alters the tramadol:M1 ratio and does not reliably enhance effects. • Taper after sustained daily use to reduce withdrawal; discontinuation may include both opioid (GI upset, aches, insomnia) and SNRI‑like symptoms (irritability, anxiety, electric‑shock sensations). • Max typical IR adult total daily dose is 400 mg; many adverse events and seizures are reported above this. Extended‑release products have different limits—follow product‑specific guidance. • Not recommended in children <12 years; contraindicated for post‑tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy analgesia in <18 years. Breastfeeding is discouraged due to risk of high M1 exposure in infants of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers. • Avoid driving or hazardous tasks until you’ve tested individual response on a separate day; sedation and delayed peak can impair performance hours after dosing. • Heat, dehydration, and long dance/party settings increase risks from serotonergic toxicity; hydrate, cool, and seek help early if overheating or confusion occurs.",

Carry naloxone and ensure others know how and when to use it; longer naloxone monitoring or infusion may be needed when active metabolites accumulate (e.g., renal impairment). In renal impairment, morphine’s active metabolite morphine‑6‑glucuronide (M6G) accumulates and can markedly prolong and intensify effects; consider lower doses, wider spacing, or alternative opioids with less renal elimination. Do not crush or chew prolonged‑release morphine (dose dumping) and never inject tamper‑resistant or oral formulations; insoluble excipients raise the risk of emboli and infections. If injecting occurs despite risks, strict harm‑reduction includes single‑use sterile syringes and sterile water, skin prep with alcohol, and micron/wheel filtration to remove particulates. Start low and go slow, with ample time before redosing (at least one full peak window), particularly for opioid‑naïve users or when mixing with other sedating medicines. Avoid driving or operating machinery for many hours after dosing; residual psychomotor impairment can outlast peak analgesia. Expect constipation (tolerance develops poorly); hydration, fiber, and proactive bowel regimens reduce risk. Pruritus and hypotension are more likely with rapid IV bolus due to non‑IgE histamine release; slower titration mitigates this. For non‑medical products/powders, variability and adulteration (e.g., unexpected potency or other actives) are common—use drug‑checking where available, test a small amount first, and avoid mixing with other depressants. Opioid‑induced hyperalgesia can occur with chronic or high‑dose exposure; increasing dose may worsen pain—consider reassessment and tapering strategies if analgesia paradoxically declines.",

User reports and The Drug Users Bible indicate very fast onset and meaningful effects from single-digit milligram doses. Batch-to-batch variability is common in the NPS market.\n- Vaporizing and insufflation produce rapid spikes that strongly reinforce compulsive redosing (“fiending”), increasing cardiovascular strain, sleep loss, and psychosis risk; many users describe vaping as particularly moreish. Avoid marathon sessions; plan hard stops and sleep recovery.\n- Intranasal use is described as caustic/irritating; some users report significant nasal damage and bleeding lasting days. Consider oral routes to reduce local harm, though systemic risks remain. Rinse nasal passages with saline post-use if insufflating.\n- Psychosis, paranoia, and severe anxiety are commonly reported during binges or after prolonged sleep deprivation. Strictly limit session length, ensure sleep, and avoid redosing when anxiety or tachycardia rise.\n- Cardiovascular risks include tachycardia, hypertension, chest pain, and vasoconstriction; avoid if you have heart disease, arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, or are on interacting meds. Seek medical care for persistent chest pain, severe headache, or confusion.\n- Maintain hydration and electrolytes; avoid overheating. Stimulants can suppress appetite—plan nutrition, limit caffeine.\n- Avoid combining with MAOIs or other potent stimulants due to hypertensive and hyperadrenergic crises. Be cautious with tramadol or bupropion (lowered seizure threshold) and with serotonergic meds (agitation/overstimulation).\n- Reagent test and, where possible, use lab drug-checking; cathinone markets are adulterated and mislabeling among pyrovalerone analogues is common.\n- Tolerance builds quickly during repeated use and fades over days to weeks; frequent redosing escalates total intake rapidly. Space sessions by at least 1–2 weeks to reduce compulsive patterns.\n- Using benzodiazepines or alcohol to ‘come down’ can mask warning signs and add respiratory risk if combined; if used, keep doses minimal, avoid alcohol/opioids, and prioritize sleep hygiene.\n- Avoid IV use; it greatly increases acute harms and addiction liability and is not supported by harm-reduction communities for this class.",

    "notes": "• Dosage and timing: Community-sourced reference doses for IPPH converge around oral 5–20 mg common and insufflated 5–20 mg common; start low and allow full onset before redosing to avoid inadvertent stacking. This is based on reference figures compiled in Drug Users Bible and corroborating forum reports.\n• ROA-specific onset: Intranasal onset is typically faster (≈5–15 min) and duration shorter than oral; this mirrors methylphenidate’s ROA differences and is echoed in user reports for IPPH. Avoid interpreting a slow oral come-up as a cue to redose early.\n• Nasal harm: Multiple user reports describe significant intranasal discomfort with phenidates, including IPPH; repeated snorting can irritate/damage mucosa. Prefer oral use, space sessions widely, and if snorted, perform gentle saline rinses hours later (not immediately). Avoid adding baking soda or ad hoc buffers—these can worsen irritation or alter absorption unpredictably.\n• Cardiovascular risk: As an NDRI stimulant, IPPH can raise heart rate and blood pressure; those with hypertension, arrhythmias, or cardiovascular disease should avoid. If severe headache, chest pain, or BP approaches emergency ranges, seek help promptly.\n• Caffeine synergy: Even small IPPH doses combined with high caffeine loads can produce tremor, jitteriness, and eye twitching; moderate caffeine and avoid energy drinks on IPPH days.\n• Alcohol: Co-use increases overall strain and can impair judgment; unlike methylphenidate, IPPH was developed in part to reduce certain interaction liabilities, but human data are limited. Prefer to avoid alcohol on IPPH.\n• Seizure threshold: Combining stimulants with bupropion or tramadol may lower seizure threshold; keep doses conservative, avoid sleep deprivation, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., after heavy sweating), and do not mix with MAOIs.\n• Compulsive redosing: Users describe milder euphoria than methylphenidate but still report redosing loops; pre-measure and limit access to discourage binges.\n• Sleep: Insomnia can occur, especially with late-day dosing; set a personal cutoff several hours before bedtime and prioritize recovery sleep after use days.\n• Drug checking: IPPH has appeared in checking program submissions; verify identity where services exist, and be aware that mislabeled stimulants circulate.\n• Legal note (UK): Phenidates including IPPH were targeted in UK controls in 2015; possession/supply laws evolved—always check your current local law before purchase or possession.

    "notes": "Identification and naming: Nitrazepam is a long-acting nitrobenzodiazepine; common brand name is Mogadon and synonyms include RO 5-3059 and RO 4-5360—use correct naming to avoid confusing it with flunitrazepam or other benzos. Residual impairment: Because the elimination half-life averages 26 hours (range ~15–38 h), next‑day psychomotor impairment and a 'hangover' effect are common, even if you feel subjectively sober. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided until fully recovered. Interindividual variability: Oral bioavailability spans ~53–94%, so two people given the same dose can have very different effects; titrate slowly and avoid stacking doses. Combination risks: Co‑use with opioids, alcohol, barbiturates or GHB/GBL markedly increases the risk of respiratory depression, loss of consciousness and fatal overdose; if any depressants are involved, do not use alone and have naloxone available when opioids are present. General CNS depressant stacking (e.g., Z‑drugs, sedating antihistamines, gabapentinoids) also increases blackout and breathing suppression risk—avoid or use only with strong safeguards. Caffeine and stimulants may mask sedation without restoring coordination or reaction time; DrugBank advises limiting caffeine and strictly avoiding alcohol while on nitrazepam. Tolerance/withdrawal: Regular use can produce tolerance within weeks and dependence; abrupt discontinuation can cause severe withdrawal including seizures—medical tapering is essential. Populations: Older adults and those with liver impairment are more prone to prolonged sedation, confusion, and falls—use lower doses with extra monitoring. Legality/access: Nitrazepam is not marketed in the United States (reducing legitimate supply there); in unregulated markets, counterfeit 'benzos' may contain more potent analogues—drug checking and conservative dosing are strongly advised. Therapeutic note: Beyond hypnotic use, nitrazepam has anticonvulsant properties (e.g., myoclonic seizures), but non-medical redosing to chase sedation can rapidly escalate risk due to delayed peaks and long half-life.",

    "notes": "Nimetazepam is marketed mainly in parts of Asia (e.g., as 5 mg 'Erimin 5'); non-medical availability often involves counterfeit tablets that may contain other benzodiazepines, making potency unpredictable—assume unknown composition and avoid mixed-source pills unless lab-checked. Next‑day sedation, impaired coordination, and memory gaps are common with long/medium-acting benzodiazepines; avoid driving or operating machinery until at least the day after use and longer if residual effects are present. Combining benzodiazepines with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, or other depressants greatly increases the risk of life‑threatening respiratory depression and fatal overdose; avoid co‑use and never use alone. Tolerance develops quickly with repeated use and can encourage escalation; spacing uses by weeks and avoiding consecutive‑night dosing reduces risk of rapid tolerance. Abrupt cessation after sustained use can cause severe withdrawal (anxiety, insomnia, agitation, tremor, seizures); any taper should be slow and medically supervised. 'Blackout' amnesia can lead to unintentional redosing—pre‑measure a single dose, keep a log, and have a trusted sober person hold the supply if needed. Crushing or injecting tablets is dangerous due to insoluble binders/fillers (risk of vein damage, infection) and unpredictable kinetics; stick to oral use only. People who are pregnant can produce neonates with benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms; discuss any exposure with a clinician. Older adults and those with renal or general frailty have heightened sensitivity to sedation and falls; lower thresholds and longer spacing are prudent. Reports note nimetazepam may partially metabolise to nitrazepam and has high oral bioavailability with relatively rapid onset—this can increase misuse potential; extra caution with redosing is warranted. In unregulated markets, prioritize drug checking where available; if not, avoid brand‑dependent assumptions (e.g., 'Erimin 5' logo) as authenticity is unreliable.",

    "notes": "Harm‑reduction justifications and key cautions: 1) Steep dose–response: the gap between desired effects and unrousable sleep/coma is small; small misestimations or redoses can cause loss of consciousness and respiratory depression. Therefore, start low, measure precisely, and avoid redosing for at least 2 hours; set a timer to prevent ‘stacking’. Community and agency guides consistently emphasise this risk. 2) Liquids vary in strength: illicit GHB/GBL solutions differ widely and sellers often cannot state concentration. Dose by mass where possible; if using liquid, use a 1–3 ml oral syringe to 0.1 ml, never caps or swigs. Always label and keep your dose with you to avoid accidental ingestion by others. 3) Prodrugs differ: GBL and 1,4‑BD convert to GHB but generally have faster onset and, for GBL, more potency by volume; never substitute ml‑for‑ml with GHB. Always dilute GBL; it is an industrial solvent and can irritate mucosa. 4) Absolutely avoid mixing with other depressants (alcohol, benzos, opioids, Z‑drugs, sedating antihistamines): combinations greatly increase risk of vomiting, aspiration, respiratory arrest, coma, and death. 5) Redose discipline: despite a short plasma half‑life, functional effects and risk persist several hours; impulsive redosing to chase euphoria or to force sleep is a common pathway to overdose and dependence. 6) Chemsex context and consent: GHB/GBL can cause amnesia and incapacitation; use only with trusted people, avoid unlabeled communal drinks, and plan for explicit consent. 7) Overdose first aid: if someone becomes unresponsive, place in the recovery position, keep airway clear, monitor breathing, and call emergency services; do not give caffeine or stimulants or additional substances. Vomit aspiration is a key danger while unconscious. 8) Tolerance/dependence: use on consecutive days or frequent ‘around‑the‑clock’ dosing can produce rapid tolerance and severe, potentially life‑threatening withdrawal; limit use to no more than 2–3 days per week and avoid overnight patterns of dosing unless prescribed/clinically supervised. 9) Food and timing: taking on a full stomach can blunt/delay onset; alcohol is metabolised before GHB, so co‑use can lead to accumulation and delayed overdose. 10) Driving and machinery: impairment can persist beyond subjective effects; avoid for the rest of the day after use.",

    "notes": "- Combining temazepam with alcohol, opioids, or GHB/GBL greatly increases the risk of unpredictable deep sedation, respiratory depression, aspiration, and fatal overdose; multiple harm‑reduction teams flag benzodiazepine + depressant combos as particularly high risk. Keep clear separation and avoid co‑use; if opioids are involved, ensure naloxone availability and avoid using alone.\n- Avoid injecting or snorting. Former gel‑filled capsules (“jellies”) led to injection attempts; reports note this formulation was withdrawn in many places due to harms. Temazepam is very poorly water‑soluble (~0.164 mg/mL), so solutions are prone to precipitation and excipient emboli, raising risks of vascular injury, abscess, and tissue necrosis. Oral use is the safer route.\n- Expect amnesia and blackouts at higher doses or with redosing. To reduce harm: pre‑measure a single dose; secure the remainder; avoid online purchases/activities, driving, cooking, or important decisions while under the influence. Next‑day impairment is common; do not drive or operate machinery until fully alert.\n- Tolerance builds quickly with nightly use (often within 2–4 weeks). Dependence and medically significant withdrawal (including seizures) can occur; any long‑term user should taper gradually under medical supervision rather than stopping abruptly.\n- People with respiratory disease, sleep apnoea, or when combined with other sedatives are at higher risk of hypoventilation/airway obstruction; the primary serious risk with benzodiazepines is respiratory depression in vulnerable contexts or polydrug use. Use the lowest effective dose, avoid co‑depressants, and do not use alone.\n- In pregnancy and breastfeeding, prescribed benzodiazepines may be used only when clinically justified; misuse/polydrug use increases risks (e.g., infant sedation/apnoea). Discuss with a clinician; avoid non‑medical use.\n- Drug testing: urine immunoassays typically detect temazepam for ~1–2 days (longer after injecting); hair tests may reflect longer‑term use. Be aware that various benzos and metabolites can cross‑react.\n- Street names for temazepam include “duck eggs” and “jellies”; be wary of non‑pharmaceutical sources due to mislabeling and unknown potency. Prefer known pharmaceutical tablets/capsules if prescribed. ",

    "notes": "Mechanism: pipradrol and its congeners act predominantly as norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors, which aligns with stimulation, insomnia, tachycardia, and anxiety at higher doses. Pharmacokinetic notes indicate rapid absorption and rapid plasma clearance with drug not detectable ~4 hours post-dose, yet central stimulation can outlast plasma presence, so timing and avoiding redosing are critical. Historical products (Meratran) contained 1 mg tablets, underscoring high potency and the need for milligram-accurate measurement or volumetric dosing. Overdose/overuse has been associated with anxiety, insomnia, abdominal discomfort, and in severe cases convulsions; individuals with psychosis, schizophrenia, or significant anxiety disorders should avoid due to exacerbation risk. Combining with MAOIs is dangerous with stimulant-class agents; mixing with other stimulants increases cardiovascular and neurotoxic stress and strongly elevates insomnia/psychosis risk. Tramadol and bupropion both lower the seizure threshold and have adverse interaction reports with stimulants; avoid. Because pipradrol-family powders have been mis-sold or confused with far longer-acting analogues (e.g., 2‑DPMP), confirm identity via reagent plus laboratory drug-checking when possible (GC/MS or FTIR); do not assume vendor labels are accurate. Insufflation provides no safety advantage, increases local harm, and may promote compulsive redosing; oral administration allows more controlled onset. Dose early in the day, maintain hydration and nutrition, and schedule a buffer for sleep; do not stack sedatives to ‘force’ sleep, as this can create risky polydrug situations.",

    "notes": "2‑DPMP is a very long‑acting, highly potent NDRI; delayed onset (up to ~2 h) often leads to premature redosing and multi‑day wakefulness.

Re‑dosing during the same day (or within 24 h) significantly increases chances of severe agitation, paranoia, and insomnia lasting 1–3 days, with numerous reports of psychosis after multi‑day wakefulness. Intranasal use is commonly reported as caustic to nasal mucosa and provides no safety benefit over oral dosing. Because of the long half‑life, avoid evening dosing; plan for sleep disruption and do not ‘stack’ doses if effects feel light in the first 2 hours. People with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, or significant anxiety/psychotic disorders should avoid 2‑DPMP due to elevated risks (tachycardia, hypertension, panic, psychosis). If severe symptoms appear (chest pain, confusion, hyperthermia, seizures, or unmanageable agitation), seek urgent medical care; supportive cooling, hydration, and clinical benzodiazepines are typical first‑line approaches for stimulant toxicity—do not rely on alcohol or self‑sedation. Mislabeling/substitution has historically been an issue (e.g., ‘Ivory Wave’ products); use professional drug checking where available and wait at least 2 hours after an initial test dose before any consideration of re‑dose. Repeated day‑to‑day use rapidly increases adverse mental effects and yields diminishing functional benefits; spacing uses by multiple weeks lowers harm. Avoid driving or high‑risk tasks with sleep loss or residual stimulation present.",

    "notes": "Gabapentin’s absorption relies on a saturable transporter (LAT1), so the fraction absorbed falls as single‑dose size increases; very large single doses provide diminishing returns but more side‑effects like ataxia and confusion. Evidence indicates T_max ~2–3 h and elimination half‑life ~5–7 h with renal excretion of unchanged drug, so people with impaired kidney function can accumulate the drug; lower doses and longer spacing are safer in renal impairment. Food has minimal clinically significant effect on absorption for immediate‑release gabapentin; however, co‑administration with potent CNS depressants (especially opioids) materially raises risks of oversedation, hypoventilation, and death. Community and clinical harm‑reduction reports document misuse in some settings, particularly in combination with opioids to potentiate effects; this pattern is over‑represented in high‑risk groups (e.g., opioid‑dependent or incarcerated people). Chronic daily use can lead to tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome on abrupt cessation (e.g., anxiety, agitation, insomnia); slow tapers reduce this risk. Cimetidine can reduce gabapentin renal clearance by ~12%; although modest, combine cautiously with other sedatives or in renal impairment. Intranasal use is reported anecdotally but is inefficient and increases local harm; oral use is the least risky route. Do not mix with alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z‑drugs, or opioids; if opioids are used medically, avoid co‑timing and keep doses low with supervision. Avoid driving or hazardous tasks during peak and until you know your personal sensitivity; next‑day sedation and impaired coordination are common at higher doses, especially with other depressants. Misjudging redose timing is common due to delayed onset at higher doses; wait at least 2–3 hours before considering any redose, and avoid stacking with other depressants altogether. These points are drawn from pharmacology texts (DrugBank/NCBI) and harm‑reduction orgs (DrugWise) plus corroborating community reports.",

Residual psychomotor impairment can persist 9–11+ hours; avoid driving or hazardous tasks the next morning and allow a full 8+ hours time in bed. Bitter/metallic taste (dysgeusia) and dry mouth are common and may persist into the next day. Co‑use with other depressants (alcohol, opioids, gabapentinoids, sedating antipsychotics/antihistamines) markedly increases risk of respiratory depression, blackouts, falls, and crashes; avoid such combinations. Hepatic impairment prolongs half‑life and increases next‑day effects; lower doses and extra caution are indicated. Redosing during the same night increases amnesia and disinhibition; due to memory gaps, some users unintentionally redose—pre‑plan a single dose and secure the remainder. If dependence has developed, avoid abrupt cessation; a supervised, gradual taper is safer due to seizure risk. Do not confuse racemic zopiclone dosing (commonly 7.5 mg) with eszopiclone (Lunesta; 1–3 mg)—they are related but not dose‑equivalent.",

    "notes": "Reasoning for additions and changes precedes this JSON. See below.\n\n1) Dose and duration verification: Multiple harm-reduction sources converge on an oral onset around 20–45 minutes and a 4–8 hour main effect window; users often report 300 mg as a common recreational dose, with tolerance driving some to escalate. These ranges justify keeping the listed oral ranges but adding a caution about variability and rapid tolerance. Source: Erowid Methaqualone Basics and Vault.\n2) Depressant combinations: Combining methaqualone with alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioids, or GHB/GBL is high-risk due to additive/synergistic CNS and respiratory depression; aspiration risk rises if unconscious. TripSit’s combination guidance and DrugWise’s interaction notes support class-based cautions; therefore these are placed under 'dangerous' and 'unsafe', with first-generation antihistamines under 'caution'. Sources: TripSit Drug Combinations; DrugWise Alcohol/Drug interactions pages.\n3) Tolerance & overdose risk: Erowid notes that tolerance develops quickly and that tolerance to euphoric effects rises faster than to respiratory depression, increasing overdose risk as people escalate doses. This justifies explicit tolerance guidance and conservative redose advice. Source: Erowid Methaqualone Basics.\n4) Dependence & withdrawal: Methaqualone’s sedative-hypnotic profile and historical clinical experience resemble barbiturates in dependence potential; barbiturate-class withdrawal can be severe and occasionally life-threatening (seizures, delirium), warranting medical supervision for cessation after heavy/prolonged use. This supports strengthening the dependence warning. Source: DrugWise Barbiturates (clinical HR context for sedative-hypnotic withdrawal).\n5) Pharmacokinetics and interactions: DrugBank lists methaqualone as a CYP3A/CYP3A4 substrate. While quantitative PK is sparse publicly, this supports a pragmatic caution that strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., certain azoles/macrolides/cimetidine) may raise levels and inducers (e.g., rifampin/carbamazepine) may lower them. We therefore add a general CYP3A4 caution under 'caution' interactions and mark half-life as uncertain/variable. Source: DrugBank DB04833.\n6) Legality & supply quality: Methaqualone is widely controlled (e.g., US Schedule I; UK Class B). Illicit supply is common and identity may be unreliable; users should treat unknown 'quaalude' tablets/powders as suspect and use lab-based drug checking where available. Sources: Isomerdesign scheduling index; Saferparty Zürich and Toronto’s Drug Checking Service (availability of lab drug checking).\n7) Practical HR: Because onset can be delayed toward an hour (or longer with food), impatient redosing increases overdose risk. Keep first sessions at the low end of 'light', avoid alcohol/other depressants entirely, and do not drive/operate machinery during the experience or the following morning if residual sedation persists. Put anyone overly sedated/unconscious in the recovery position and seek medical help; this is standard depressant HR reflected in TripSit and DrugWise resources.\n8) Names/brands/slang: Common brand/colloquial names (Quaalude, Sopor, Mandrax, Ludes/714s) are documented in the Erowid vault; including them improves cross-referencing and counterfeit awareness.\n9) Data quality: Many contemporary details (dosage in illicit contexts, effect timings) derive from user reports and HR archives; we therefore label tolerance and some PK elements as low-to-anecdotal quality and encourage drug checking for identification.\n\nAdditional harm-reduction notes: Illicit tablets/powders may contain benzodiazepines, sedating antihistamines, or other depressants; assume variability and test where possible. Escalating to 'strong/heavy' ranges substantially increases ataxia, amnesia, and respiratory compromise; do not combine with any other downer. Consider spacing uses by at least several days to a week to reduce tolerance and risk of dose escalation. Keep sessions in a safe environment with a sober sitter if new to the drug. If dependent or using daily, do not stop abruptly; seek medical support for tapering. These points synthesize the above sources and widely accepted HR practice for depressants. ",

Concomitant or closely timed use (up to ~15 weeks after last dose, reflecting the long half-life) with halofantrine or ketoconazole is specifically warned against due to life‑threatening QTc prolongation; other QT‑affecting drugs warrant caution. A history of major psychiatric disorders (depression, GAD, psychosis, schizophrenia) or seizures is a contraindication to prophylactic use; hypersensitivity to quinine/quinidine is also a contraindication. Due to vestibular and neuropsychiatric risks, use caution with activities requiring alertness and fine motor control (driving, piloting, operating machinery, diving). Start prophylaxis at least 1 week before travel (2 weeks often recommended when feasible) to assess tolerability; continue for 4 weeks after return. Food increases absorption (~40%); take weekly doses with food and water, and avoid alcohol around dosing to reduce CNS side effects. Mefloquine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a P‑gp substrate/inhibitor; strong CYP3A4 inhibitors raise exposure and inducers (e.g., rifampin) lower exposure and may compromise efficacy. With chronic/long‑term use, liver enzyme elevations occur in a subset of users; periodic LFT monitoring is advised in prolonged courses and elimination is prolonged in hepatic impairment. Women and individuals with low BMI may be at higher risk for certain neuropsychiatric adverse effects in some cohorts; concurrent alcohol or other chronic medications has been associated with increased adverse event reporting. Breastmilk contains low mefloquine concentrations insufficient to protect an infant; breastfeeding infants require their own antimalarial prophylaxis where indicated.",

    "notes": "4-AcO-DET likely deacetylates in vivo to 4-HO-DET (ethocin), so potency, onset, and duration can vary with metabolism; users report both short (2–4 h) and longer (6–8 h) courses. Anecdotal reports describe stronger, shorter effects via intranasal or smoked routes, but these also carry more irritation and unpredictability; oral is the most characterized and generally lowest risk ROA. Like other 4-substituted tryptamines, nausea and GI unease can occur, particularly on the come-up; fasting 3–4 h and using ginger/antiemetic strategies may help. Avoid mixing with MAOIs, tramadol, DXM, or linezolid due to serotonin toxicity risk; lithium with psychedelics has repeatedly been linked with seizures and severe adverse reactions in community reports. SSRIs/SNRIs and some antipsychotics may attenuate psychedelic effects, but they can still contribute to serotonergic burden; effects can be unpredictable. Misrepresentation in the gray/illicit market is a documented risk (e.g., tryptamines sold as psilocybin or vice versa); reagent testing (Ehrlich for indoles) and lab drug checking reduce this risk, although reagents cannot confirm exact identity. Store away from heat, moisture, and light; 4-AcO esters can hydrolyze over time to 4-HO analogs—color changes (tanning/darkening) have been reported alongside retained potency, but degradation is formulation- and storage-dependent. Tolerance builds rapidly after a single session and decays over about 1–2 weeks; cross-tolerance exists with other classical psychedelics (psilocin/psilocybin, LSD, other 4-sub tryptamines). Set and setting strongly influence outcomes; a trusted sober sitter, safe environment, and clear intentions reduce risk of panic and dangerous behavior. Seek urgent medical help for signs of serotonin toxicity (agitation, hyperthermia, tremor/clonus, confusion), chest pain, persistent vomiting, seizures, or severe confusion; disclose all substances to responders.",

    "notes": "Estradiol is a systemic estrogen used for menopausal therapy, hypogonadism, and as part of gender-affirming hormone therapy; local vaginal products have minimal systemic absorption and generally do not carry systemic estrogen risks at low doses. Unopposed systemic estrogen increases endometrial hyperplasia/cancer risk in people with an intact uterus; co-administer an appropriate progestogen or use combined products. Oral estrogen increases hepatic protein synthesis (e.g., clotting factors), raising VTE risk—risk is highest in the first year; transdermal estradiol shows far less impact on coagulation markers and is preferred in patients with VTE risk factors or hypertriglyceridemia. Estrogen therapy can increase the risk of gallbladder disease; transdermal routes mitigate first-pass hepatic effects relative to oral. Estrogens raise TBG and other binding globulins, which can increase total thyroid and cortisol measurements without necessarily changing free fractions; hypothyroid patients may need higher levothyroxine doses after starting systemic estrogen. In people on lamotrigine, estrogen-containing therapies can lower lamotrigine levels (via UGT induction), risking seizure or mood relapse—monitor symptoms/levels and adjust lamotrigine as needed. Avoid supraphysiological estradiol dosing; higher oral doses increase thrombotic risk without clear added benefit; consider non-oral routes to minimize hepatic effects. Monitor: blood pressure, lipids (particularly triglycerides with oral estrogen), liver enzymes if indicated, prolactin (mild increases are common; rare macroprolactinomas reported with high-dose exposure), and for signs of VTE (unilateral leg swelling, chest pain, dyspnea). Smoking, older age, obesity, prolonged immobility, known thrombophilia, and prior VTE elevate risk; address modifiable risks and prefer transdermal route when systemic estrogen is needed. For IM esters, expect peak levels in days 2–7 and a decline over 1–3 weeks; dose timing can be adjusted to reduce symptom cycling; never inject IV.",

Start with 3–5 mg to assess sensitivity and avoid redosing within the first 2 hours to reduce risk of headaches, irritability, or insomnia. Insomnia is more likely with late-day dosing; avoid taking after mid-afternoon until you understand your response. Headaches are reported and often ascribed by users to cholinergic imbalance; while some find choline supplements helpful, controlled evidence is limited—add only if a consistent personal benefit is observed and keep doses modest. Combination with alcohol has produced unpleasant and risky experiences for some (confusion, dysphoria); if mixing, use minimal alcohol and avoid escalating either substance. Co-administration with phenibut or other CNS depressants can unpredictably blunt or intensify effects—space uses by at least 12–24 hours and avoid first-time combinations. Intranasal use is not recommended due to local irritation and uncertain bioavailability; oral or sublingual routes are safer and sufficient. If using daily, consider cycling (e.g., several weeks on followed by a similar or longer break) to limit tolerance and evaluate ongoing need; data are anecdotal and long-term safety is not established. Avoid in pregnancy/breastfeeding and in individuals with uncontrolled anxiety or sleep disorders until a cautious single low-dose trial in a safe setting demonstrates tolerability. Do not drive or operate machinery on first use or after dose changes, given interindividual variability and occasional paradoxical anxiety or sedation.",

Discontinue and seek medical advice if any occur. Evidence includes emergency department data and labeling summaries.\n• Next‑day impairment (memory, reaction time, driving) can persist, especially with extended‑release forms and higher doses. Patients should avoid driving or hazardous tasks the following morning if not fully alert.\n• Take immediately before bed with the intention and ability to sleep 7–8 hours (4+ hours for low‑dose sublingual “middle‑of‑the‑night” products). Redosing during the night greatly increases amnesia and complex behaviors.\n• Women generally have higher exposure from the same dose due to lower clearance; many regulators and labels recommend lower initial doses for women. Elderly patients and those with hepatic impairment also have increased exposure and fall risk; they typically require lower doses and careful monitoring.\n• Food delays absorption and may prolong residual effects; for fastest onset and least next‑day impairment take on an empty stomach and do not combine with alcohol.\n• Avoid combining with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzos, GHB, barbiturates, gabapentinoids, sedating antihistamines/antipsychotics); these combinations increase amnesia, accidental injury, respiratory depression, and overdose risk.\n• Dependence and withdrawal can occur (anxiety, tremor, rebound insomnia; seizures have been reported after high‑dose, prolonged use). Do not abruptly stop after chronic/heavy use; seek medical guidance for a taper.\n• Hepatic impairment can prolong zolpidem half‑life to ~10 hours on average (wide range), increasing next‑day impairment and accumulation risk; dose reductions are warranted and extended‑release should be avoided in significant impairment.\n• Serious allergic reactions (angioedema/anaphylaxis) are reported; discontinue and seek urgent care if swelling or breathing problems occur.\n• Use extreme caution in sleep apnea, chronic respiratory disease, or with opioid therapy due to additive respiratory depression and hypoxemia risk.\n• Extended‑release tablets must not be crushed or split; crushing/insufflating tablets or using non‑oral routes adds risk from excipients and rapid CNS depression without improving safety or outcomes.",

Onset can be subtle; avoid redosing during the first 2–3 hours as tolerance rises quickly and effects may surge later. People with seizure disorders, on lithium, or taking serotonergic drugs (SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, tramadol, DXM, 5-HTP) should avoid DiPT due to seizure or serotonin-toxicity concerns. Set/setting and a sober sitter are recommended—auditory scene distortions can impair communication and situational awareness. Use drug checking: reagent tests help confirm a tryptamine (e.g., Ehrlich), but laboratory confirmation via GC/MS (e.g., DrugsData) best verifies identity.

    "notes": "Reasoning for harm-reduction additions (with sources): 1) Fluconazole is a clinically used antifungal and a known inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. This mechanistically explains many drug–drug interactions; classing it under medical use (not a supplement) and emphasizing enzyme inhibition reduces interaction-related harm. Source: DrugBank BioInteractors lists fluconazole as an inhibitor of CYP3A4/2C9/2C19 and ABCB1, supporting interaction caution. 2) Opioid combinations: fluconazole can raise levels of methadone (trial specifically assessing the interaction) and has a published case report with fentanyl; both raise risk of oversedation, respiratory depression, and QT prolongation. Sources: DrugBank clinical trial listing for fluconazole–methadone pharmacokinetics; drugs-forum abstract of a fentanyl–fluconazole case report in Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 3) QT prolongation risk: Azole antifungals including fluconazole appear in studies of torsades de pointes/QT-prolonging inpatient medications; combining with other QT-prolongers (e.g., macrolides, fluoroquinolones, methadone, certain antiarrhythmics) increases risk. Source: Registry-based clinical study listing of drugs associated with QT/TdP risk including fluconazole. 4) Pregnancy: Up-to-date NIH/NCBI guideline text advises avoiding oral fluconazole in the first trimester—including single 150 mg doses—because of increased risk of spontaneous abortion; higher cumulative doses (>300 mg) associated with higher stillbirth risk in registry analyses; characteristic embryopathy reported with chronic 400 mg/day or more. This is high-stakes safety information that directly reduces fetal risk. Source: NIH/NCBI Opportunistic Infections guideline PDF (2025 update). 5) Long half-life and accumulation: fluconazole’s long elimination half-life (roughly day-scale) means serial self-redosing can silently accumulate and magnify interaction risks; spacing and avoiding unadvised repeats reduces adverse events. This aligns with standard pharmacokinetic references and the user-supplied half-life range. For conservative harm reduction, treat it as a once-daily agent unless a clinician instructs otherwise. 6) Hepatic considerations: Although severe hepatotoxicity is uncommon, azoles carry labeled liver risk; avoiding heavy alcohol and seeking care for jaundice, dark urine, severe fatigue, or mucocutaneous rash is prudent. This general precaution reduces rare but serious outcomes. 7) Renal function: Because clinically meaningful renal elimination occurs and dose adjustments are made in practice for reduced kidney function on multi-day regimens, people with kidney disease should not self-dose and should confirm adjustments with a prescriber. 8) Specific interaction flags were grouped by severity based on mechanism (potent QT-prolongers and narrow-therapeutic-index substrates placed higher) and the availability of human data (trial/case report) to mitigate the most consequential risks first. Where only mechanistic plausibility exists, items were placed under “caution.” Together these changes convert general info into actionable harm reduction focused on avoiding high-risk combinations, pregnancy exposure, and stealth accumulation.\n\nPractical harm-reduction guidance: - Verify indication and dosing with a clinician; don’t use fluconazole to self-treat vague “yeast overgrowth.” - Disclose all meds, including methadone, fentanyl, benzodiazepines, warfarin, sulfonylureas, and QT-prolonging drugs. - Avoid combining with other QT-prolongers when possible; if necessary, follow prescriber monitoring advice. - Avoid heavy alcohol and stop the drug promptly for severe rash, mucosal lesions, jaundice, or unexplained severe fatigue. - If pregnant or trying to conceive, avoid oral fluconazole in the first trimester; prefer topical therapy unless a specialist advises otherwise. - With repeated dosing, don’t “top up”—the long half-life means today’s dose stacks with prior doses.",

    "notes": "Pemoline is a CNS stimulant formerly used for ADHD and narcolepsy; FDA approval was withdrawn in 2005 after reports of acute liver failure and death, despite earlier monitoring recommendations. Avoid alcohol entirely while on pemoline; DrugBank explicitly lists alcohol avoidance and caffeine limitation, and alcohol adds independent liver risk. Baseline and periodic liver function testing is prudent if any exposure occurs; watch for warning signs of DILI (e.g., right‑upper‑quadrant pain, dark urine, pruritus, jaundice, prolonged nausea/fatigue) and stop immediately if they appear. Do not re‑challenge after suspected pemoline‑related liver injury due to risk of recurrence with greater severity. Roughly half of an oral dose is renally excreted unchanged and the serum half‑life is near 12 hours, so redosing stacks substantially; spacing doses and avoiding late‑day dosing reduces insomnia and overstimulation. Given limited euphoric effects relative to amphetamines, users may be tempted to escalate doses; this increases adverse effect risk without reliably improving therapeutic benefit. Combining with MAOIs or other stimulants increases cardiovascular/central adverse events and is discouraged by interaction guides; if any combination is unavoidable in clinical contexts, specialist oversight is essential. Because pemoline is or has been controlled (e.g., CSA Schedule IV historically) and withdrawn in many markets, products circulating online may be mislabelled; reagent testing will not assess hepatotoxicity, so sourcing does not mitigate this core risk. Consider alternative, better‑characterized treatments where available; if used off‑label, employ the lowest effective dose for the shortest feasible duration and schedule rest days.",

    "notes": "DXM polistirex is an extended‑release resin complex; its slower, flatter absorption commonly produces a weaker peak with a much longer tail than DXM HBr. Because come‑up may take 1–3 hours, premature redosing can stack exposures and lead to unexpectedly long, dysphoric, or anxious trips; wait at least 4–6 hours before considering any additional dosing and avoid it entirely with ER products. CYP2D6 genetics and inhibitors strongly change exposure: poor metabolizers (≈9%) can have ~8× higher bioavailability and ~8× longer half‑life than extensive metabolizers, producing unusually prolonged effects and higher toxicity risk; potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion) can mimic PM status. Avoid combination OTCs: acetaminophen (hepatotoxicity above ~3–4 g/day), first‑gen antihistamines (anticholinergic delirium; QT), doxylamine/diphenhydramine (delirium/seizure risk), guaifenesin (severe nausea/vomiting), and decongestants (cardiovascular strain). Mixing with serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs/SNRIs/MAOIs), tramadol, linezolid, St. John’s wort, or MDMA increases serotonin‑toxicity risk (agitation, hyperthermia, clonus, diaphoresis)—seek emergency care if these occur. Do not attempt to defeat the polistirex coating (e.g., crushing/acid tricks or crude ‘extractions’); release becomes unpredictable and may not convert to free DXM. Expect impaired coordination and judgment for the rest of the day and often into the next morning—do not drive, swim, or perform hazardous tasks for at least 12–24 hours after significant doses. Many syrups contain sorbitol and other excipients that can cause GI upset, dehydration, and electrolyte loss—sip oral fluids with electrolytes and avoid heavy physical exertion. Start low if on any psychiatric medication or with a history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, significant hypertension, or liver disease; dissociatives can precipitate mania/psychosis and increase BP/HR. Space use 2–4 weeks or longer to manage tolerance and reduce compulsive patterns; frequent redosing increases adverse mental health outcomes. Always read the exact product label: ER bottles often state ‘dextromethorphan polistirex equivalent to 30 mg DXM HBr per 5 mL’; this is a labeling equivalence for cough dosing, not a guarantee of equal recreational effect. If severe agitation, hyperthermia, rigid muscles, confusion, or seizures occur, this may signal serotonin toxicity or severe overdose—seek urgent medical help and avoid anticholinergic sedatives unless directed by a clinician.",

    "notes": "Esketamine is the S‑enantiomer of ketamine and an FDA‑/EU‑approved nasal antidepressant; it causes dose‑dependent dissociation, cognitive/motor impairment, and transient hypertension. Intranasal bioavailability is ~48% with a 20–40 minute Tmax, so redosing too quickly can overshoot into heavier sedation or a hole-like state. It acutely elevates blood pressure and heart rate, peaking ~40 minutes and lasting up to ~4 hours, so people with uncontrolled hypertension, significant cardiovascular disease, recent stroke, intracranial/intraocular pressure problems, or serious head injury should avoid unsupervised use. Combining with alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, or GHB/GBL amplifies sedation and airway compromise; if someone becomes unresponsive or vomits, place them in the recovery position and seek help. Chronic/frequent use can damage the urinary tract (ketamine cystitis), presenting with urgency, frequency, dysuria, hematuria, and sometimes severe bladder contraction; stopping early improves outcomes and heavy users have required invasive treatments in severe cases. Snorting irritates mucosa—use finely crushed material, alternate nostrils, avoid sharing snorting tools, and rinse gently with saline after sessions to reduce epistaxis and infection risk. Use seated or lying down in a safe space with a trusted sober person if doses may impair mobility, and avoid driving or hazardous tasks until fully recovered. Unregulated markets see mis‑sold powders (e.g., ketamine sold as cocaine or 2C‑B), so drug checking is strongly advised to prevent unexpected dissociation and risky redosing. Outside clinical settings, IM is generally safer than IV if injecting at all, but both require sterile equipment, accurate measurement, and understanding of rapid onset. Nausea is common—avoid heavy meals for 1–2 hours beforehand and have antiemetic strategies planned if sensitive. Tolerance builds quickly; spacing sessions by at least several days and avoiding daily use markedly reduces compulsive redosing, bladder risk, and loss of effect.",

    "notes": "Ibogaine and its active metabolite noribogaine inhibit cardiac hERG channels at clinically relevant concentrations, prolonging ventricular repolarization (QT interval) and predisposing to torsades de pointes; adverse cardiac events can appear days after a single dose due to noribogaine’s long half-life. Pre-dose screening (12-lead ECG, QTc, heart history) and correction of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium) materially reduce arrhythmia risk. High-variability plant products (root bark/TA) complicate dosing; ibogaine HCl allows weight-based calculations (typical ‘flood’ 15–25 mg/kg) but still requires continuous monitoring and ready access to advanced cardiac care. Significant ataxia, vertigo, bradycardia, and vomiting are common during peaks; patients should remain supine with assistance to minimize falls and aspiration. Because noribogaine is a strong SERT inhibitor and ibogaine/noribogaine are metabolized by polymorphic CYP2D6, poor metabolizers or those taking CYP2D6 inhibitors can experience prolonged exposure and QT risk; dose reduction and extended monitoring are prudent. Combining ibogaine with methadone and other potent QT-prolongers is a well-documented hazard; most clinical protocols require opioid transitions/washouts and continuous telemetry. Stimulants (including cocaine/amphetamines) amplify cardiac risk during and for several days post-dose; strict abstinence is recommended pre/post. Anti-emetics like ondansetron also prolong QT; if anti-nausea medication is clinically necessary, it should be selected and monitored by medical staff. Post-ibogaine, opioid tolerance often drops; relapse can therefore be more lethal—harm-reduction planning (naloxone, support, follow-up) is essential. Legal status varies widely; in many countries ibogaine is controlled or unapproved for treatment—unregulated settings may lack the monitoring capacity required for safe administration.",

During fentanyl patch therapy, a longer wait (48–72 h after removal) is advised. Alternative initiation strategies exist (e.g., low‑dose ‘micro‑induction’ while continuing a full agonist) when standard induction is not tolerated; these should be clinician‑directed. Combination products with naloxone have negligible naloxone effect when used sublingually/buccally as directed but can precipitate severe withdrawal if the product is dissolved and injected. Buprenorphine’s high receptor affinity can block other opioids for 24–72 hours; attempts to ‘break through’ with more opioids increase overdose risk, especially as buprenorphine levels decline. Sedative co‑use (benzodiazepines, alcohol, Z‑drugs, other depressants) greatly magnifies respiratory depression risk; treatment should not be withheld solely for benzodiazepine co‑use, but dosing and monitoring must be cautious. Proper sublingual technique improves effect and reduces redosing: let the film/tablet fully dissolve (often 3–10 minutes), avoid eating/drinking/smoking for ~30 minutes, and wait ≥2 hours before any reassessment dose. Transdermal patches are for analgesia in opioid‑tolerant patients; do not cut, chew, heat, or extract—misuse can cause uncontrolled release and fatal overdose. Accidental pediatric exposures (films, tablets, patches) can be lethal from a single dose; store locked and dispose securely. Hepatic impairment raises risk of toxicity; monitor liver enzymes periodically and avoid combination product in severe hepatic dysfunction. In buprenorphine overdose, reversal may require higher or repeated naloxone dosing and prolonged supportive care due to buprenorphine’s high affinity and long half‑life.",

    "notes": "- PEA is preferentially metabolized by monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), leading to a very short duration and low oral bioavailability; any MAO-B inhibition can dramatically increase exposure and physiological impact. This is the central harm-reduction issue: avoid all MAOIs (including Parkinson’s drugs and the antibiotic linezolid).\n- Selective MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline, safinamide) and nonselective/irreversible MAOIs (phenelzine, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid) can potentiate PEA to a degree that risks severe hypertension, hyperthermia, or cerebrovascular events; this risk exists even at small PEA doses when MAO is inhibited.\n- Linezolid is a reversible, nonselective MAOI used as an antibiotic; combining PEA with linezolid can precipitate dangerous pressor responses and should be strictly avoided.\n- Because the psychoactive window is brief, some users escalate to gram-level oral doses or engage in frequent redosing cycles; harm-reduction priorities include not stacking stimulants, monitoring blood pressure/heart rate, maintaining hydration, and stopping at the first signs of severe headache, chest pain, or marked flushing. These redosing patterns are consistently reported in harm-reduction forums and align with the known indirect sympathomimetic profile of PEA.\n- PEA primarily acts as an endogenous trace amine/TAAR1 agonist and an indirect sympathomimetic (catecholamine-releasing); expect tachycardia, blood pressure elevation, and anxiety at higher doses, especially with co-stimulants. Individuals with cardiovascular disease should avoid use.\n- Food-derived/background PEA (e.g., chocolate) is trivial compared to supplemental doses; however, in the presence of MAOI therapy even trace amines can become clinically significant, reinforcing the strict MAOI-avoidance guidance.\n- Urine drug testing: cross-reactivity data indicate β-phenethylamine can interfere with some assays; although not usually targeted, unexpected results should be confirmed with specific methods (e.g., GC/MS).\n- There is no established therapeutic dosing for psychoactive purposes. If an individual nevertheless chooses to experiment, conservative spacing (weeks) and strict avoidance of MAOIs and stimulant stacks are critical to reduce cumulative cardiovascular strain and compulsive redosing risk.

    "notes": "- Ephedrine is a mixed-acting sympathomimetic: it directly agonizes alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors and indirectly releases norepinephrine; this underlies its pressor, bronchodilatory, and tachycardic effects. This mechanism also explains rapid tolerance/tachyphylaxis with repeated dosing. [Cited: DrugBank DB01364].\n- Oral dosing has reasonably consistent community and clinical consensus; start at the low end and avoid frequent redosing to limit tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety, and insomnia. Deaths and severe events have been reported at higher or repeated doses and during exertion. [Cited: Erowid dosage page; AHRQ review].\n- Half-life averages about 6 hours but varies with urinary pH; at pH ~6.3 t½ ~6 h and at pH ~5 t½ ~3 h. Acidifying urine to hasten elimination is not recommended in toxicity. Plan timing to avoid nighttime insomnia. [Cited: Erowid Ephedra overview].\n- Populations at higher risk: people with hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, ischemic heart disease/heart failure, hyperthyroidism, angle-closure glaucoma, urinary retention/BPH, and renal impairment; pregnancy and lactation require caution or avoidance outside medical indications. [Cited: StatPearls Ephedrine].\n- Avoid combining with MAO inhibitors (including linezolid/methylene blue): can precipitate hypertensive crisis. If discontinuing an MAOI, wait at least 14 days before ephedrine use. Seek urgent care for severe headache, chest pain, or neurological symptoms. [Cited: StatPearls MAOIs; StatPearls Ephedrine].\n- Combining with caffeine increases adverse-event frequency (palpitations, autonomic hyperactivity, anxiety); use conservative doses, vigilant hydration, and avoid strenuous heat/exertion on the stack. [Cited: AHRQ ephedra/ephedrine+caffeine review].\n- Hydration: during stimulation, sip ~300–500 mL water per hour and include electrolytes if sweating; avoid alcohol which masks intoxication and increases dehydration risk. Saferparty provides similar guidance. [Cited: Saferparty factsheet].\n- Insufflation is higher risk than oral due to potent local vasoconstriction and mucosal dryness/irritation; expect disproportionate cardiovascular stimulation for marginal subjective benefit. If used despite risks: keep doses low, space lines, rotate nostrils, and rinse with isotonic saline after use. Prefer oral route for lower harm. [Mechanistic rationale + general harm reduction; Saferparty nasal hygiene guidance].\n- Renal clearance is predominant and can be slowed in renal impairment; dose accumulation increases adverse effects. People with kidney disease should be especially cautious and avoid repeat dosing without medical oversight. [Cited: StatPearls Ephedrine].\n- Adulteration: ephedrine is sometimes detected as an adulterant in cocaine samples, creating unexpectedly strong stimulant mixes that elevate cardiac risk; drug checking is advised. [Cited: Saferparty warning].\n- Salt forms: dosing by mass depends on the salt. Ephedrine HCl contains ~0.82 g free base per 1 g salt; ephedrine sulfate contains ~0.77 g free base per 1 g salt (approximate stoichiometric calculation). Adjust if switching forms to avoid inadvertent over- or under-dosing. [Cited: DrugBank salt entries].\n- Exercise/heat: case series link ephedra/ephedrine use to serious cardiovascular and neurologic events, especially with exertion/heat. Avoid heavy exercise and hot environments on days you take ephedrine. [Cited: NCBI report on military personnel/safety reviews]. ",

    "notes": "Why this matters and how to reduce risk: 1) Human in‑vivo pharmacokinetics are unknown; an in‑vitro study in human liver microsomes found a long metabolic half‑life (~770 min ≈ 12.8 h), so redosing can stack and prolong sympathomimetic strain even if the subjective ‘rush’ fades. Space doses and avoid consecutive‑day use. 2) Mislabeling is common: multiple Swiss drug‑checking alerts found NEP sold as 3‑MMC; because NEP is active at much lower oral doses (≈20–50 mg vs 100–200 mg for 3‑MMC), substitution markedly increases overdose risk. Use accredited drug‑checking when possible; if not, start with a very small test dose and wait fully for effects. 3) Cardiovascular and hyperthermia risks are central with cathinones; clinical cases with NEP have included severe agitation, fever, rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. Avoid hot environments and intense exertion; take cooling breaks; sip isotonic fluids (not excessive water) and replace electrolytes during prolonged activity. 4) Seizure risk is heightened by co‑factors (sleep deprivation, dehydration, tramadol, bupropion, stimulant stacking). Avoid these combinations and ensure sleep/nutrition before and after sessions. 5) Intranasal dosing produces a steeper rise, more peripheral side effects and greater compulsion than oral; vaporizing/inhalation reports often describe very short cycles with strong urges to redose and respiratory irritation—prefer oral if you choose to use at all. 6) Set maximum session amounts in advance, measure doses with a 0.001 g scale, and avoid ‘chasing’ diminishing returns—compulsion is a common pathway to harm. 7) Because NEP is frequently mis‑sold, reagents may not reliably distinguish it from other cathinones; lab drug‑checking (FTIR/GC‑MS/LC‑HRMS) is the safest way to identify contents. 8) Aftercare: expect a dysphoric ‘crash’; plan nutrition, hydration and sleep; consider a non‑sedating day off stimulants for at least 14+ days to let tolerance and cardiovascular strain normalize. 9) Seek urgent care for red‑flag symptoms: persistent chest pain, severe headache, confusion/delirium, temperature >38.5°C (101.3°F), rigid muscles, dark urine, or inability to keep fluids down.",

    "notes": "Harm-reduction reasoning and key points that informed this profile: 1) Dose and duration are highly variable; typical oral onset is within 5–45 minutes and peak CNS stimulation occurs around 30–75 minutes. Effects can persist for several hours, with residual stimulation and sleep disruption lasting into the next day at higher doses. 2) Serious toxicity is uncommon but possible; human fatalities are reported mostly from intentional or accidental ingestion of concentrated powders/shots, with estimated lethal ranges around 150–200 mg/kg and severe toxicity at gram-level intakes. 3) Half-life averages about 3–7 hours but is highly context-dependent: shorter in smokers and noticeably longer in late pregnancy and in users on oral contraceptives; neonates clear caffeine extremely slowly. 4) CYP1A2 inhibitors (notably fluvoxamine, and several quinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin) can substantially increase caffeine exposure, raising the risk of side effects (jitters, tachycardia, insomnia) at usual doses. 5) Alcohol plus caffeine is risky because caffeine can mask sedation and intoxication cues without reducing impairment; people may unintentionally over-consume alcohol. 6) Combining high-dose caffeine with other stimulants increases cardiovascular load (tachycardia, hypertension); drug-checking alerts frequently find caffeine mixed into stimulant powders/tablets, which can lead to redosing and unintended high stimulant loads. 7) During pregnancy and lactation, prudent upper limits are lower than for nonpregnant adults; caffeine crosses the placenta and appears in breast milk, and infants—especially preterm—metabolize it slowly. 8) For sleep health, avoid substantial caffeine within at least 6 hours of bedtime; even earlier cutoffs may be needed for slow metabolizers or those on CYP1A2 inhibitors. 9) Long-term daily use leads to tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome that is typically mild-to-moderate and resolves over several days; tapering intake can reduce severity. 10) People with anxiety disorders, symptomatic arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, GERD/ulcer disease, seizure disorders, or significant hepatic impairment should use caution or lower doses. 11) Changes in smoking status can alter caffeine metabolism within days; former smokers often need to reduce caffeine to avoid side effects. 12) Hydration: caffeine is a mild diuretic; habitual users develop tolerance to diuretic effects—drink to thirst rather than overhydrate. 13) Prefer measured-dose products over bulk powders; if using tablets/capsules, space redoses to avoid stacking from delayed absorption.",

Co-ingestion with alcohol or other depressants (opioids, benzodiazepines, GHB/GBL) markedly increases risk of loss of consciousness, respiratory depression, aspiration, and death—avoid these combinations entirely and place any unresponsive person in the recovery position while seeking emergency care. Chloral hydrate is metabolized primarily by alcohol dehydrogenase to trichloroethanol (active) and further to trichloroacetic acid; genetic variation and concurrent alcohol use can meaningfully alter both potency and duration between individuals. In cirrhosis or hepatic decompensation, chloral hydrate can precipitate or worsen hepatic encephalopathy; avoid use in significant liver disease and in untreated sleep apnea. Cardiac irritability/arrhythmia can occur in overdose and in susceptible individuals; those with structural heart disease or on other QT-/rhythm‑affecting drugs should avoid nonmedical use. Residual psychomotor impairment may persist into the next day due to metabolite half-lives; do not drive or operate machinery for at least a full night after dosing. Repeated frequent use rapidly builds tolerance and can cause dependence; withdrawal may begin within 12–24 hours after cessation in heavy users and may resemble alcohol/barbiturate withdrawal (including delirium)—medical supervision is strongly advised for dependent users. Oral and rectal routes can irritate mucosa; always dilute liquids and avoid concentrated solutions to reduce GI irritation; injection is strongly discouraged due to vein and tissue irritation. Products and syrups may vary in concentration; use an accurate milligram scale or clearly labeled pharmaceutical preparations to avoid dosing errors. Breast milk transfer occurs and may sedate infants; avoid during pregnancy and lactation unless medically supervised. If severe vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, confusion, or shallow breathing occur after use, seek emergency help immediately and avoid giving more depressants while awaiting care.",

    "notes": "Etonitazene is an ultra-potent benzimidazole opioid; class reports place it at roughly 1,000–1,500× morphine potency in animals, implying microgram-level human activity and an extreme overdose risk from tiny mismeasurements. It has appeared in the unregulated supply, sometimes sold as or alongside other opioids or as counterfeit pills; related etonitazene analogs have been detected in tablets marked as oxycodone. Nitazenes are often below the detection limits of common onsite spectrometers (e.g., FTIR at ~5% w/w), and available nitazene test strips may not reliably detect all analogs; lab-based drug checking is recommended. Mixed-depressant use (benzodiazepines, alcohol, GHB/GBL, Z-drugs, barbiturates) greatly increases the risk of rapid, profound respiratory depression and death. Co-use with gabapentinoids (gabapentin/pregabalin) is epidemiologically associated with higher opioid-related mortality and should be avoided. In suspected opioid poisoning, naloxone should be administered promptly; multiple repeat doses and prolonged monitoring can be required because nitazenes may outlast naloxone, with risk of renarcotization after initial reversal. Fentanyl test strips detect fentanyl-class opioids; they do not identify which nitazene is present and onsite tools can miss nitazenes—negative results do not guarantee safety. Never “eyeball” or guess amounts; microgram-active materials require precision handling, and insufflation or injection sharply elevates risk. Avoid using alone; ensure bystanders can recognize opioid overdose (unresponsiveness, slow or stopped breathing, pinpoint pupils) and can administer naloxone while calling emergency services.",

    "notes": "Ibotenic acid is an excitatory amino acid and a known neurotoxin in laboratory settings; it acts primarily as an agonist at NMDA and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors, and a proportion decarboxylates in vivo or during preparation to muscimol, a potent GABA-A agonist that mediates most desired Amanita effects. Drying and/or heating Amanita material decarboxylates ibotenic acid to muscimol; avoiding raw or under-prepared material meaningfully reduces nausea, dysautonomia, and confusion. Onset can be markedly delayed (often up to 2–3 hours), so redosing during the come-up substantially increases the risk of oversedation, delirium, and emesis later in the session. Clinical series show a characteristic mixture of GI upset (nausea/vomiting), CNS depression (somnolence, confusion), and CNS excitation (agitation, hallucinations); severe cases may require airway protection and benzodiazepines under medical care. Both ibotenic acid and muscimol are rapidly absorbed and readily excreted in urine; laboratory confirmation is possible within hours of ingestion, which also explains historical reports of urine recycling—this does not imply safety and is not a harm-reduction practice. Potency varies widely between Amanita species, locations, and seasons; even adjacent mushrooms can differ substantially, so dosing strategies based on mushroom count or unstandardized extracts are unreliable. Do not drive, swim, or perform hazardous tasks the day of use and consider residual impairment the next day; have a sober sitter to manage sudden somnolence or disorientation. Avoid combining with alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, or other sedatives because muscimol-mediated sedation and vomiting increase aspiration and injury risks. Children appear more prone to severe presentations (e.g., ataxia, seizures) after Amanita exposures; pregnant or breastfeeding individuals and those with seizure history should avoid entirely. In the U.S., Amanita muscaria and its constituents are not federally controlled substances, but the FDA has stated that Amanita muscaria and its constituents (including muscimol and ibotenic acid) are not GRAS food additives, and retail products are unregulated; mislabeling and variable decarboxylation are common. Seek urgent care if severe agitation, persistent vomiting, chest pain, seizures, or inability to stay awake occur; clinicians commonly use supportive care with benzodiazepines for agitation or seizures and observation until resolution.",

    "notes": "Potency estimates for metonitazene vary by source and matrix; drug checking data has described it as roughly fentanyl-strength in some periods and up to ~4× fentanyl in others, underscoring high uncertainty across batches. It has increasingly appeared as an adulterant in samples not expected to contain high‑potency opioids (e.g., counterfeit oxycodone/“Percocet”, hydromorphone, and even cocaine/other non‑opioids), so assume unknown powders or pressed pills may contain a nitazene. Nitazenes, including metonitazene, are frequently found with other depressants such as benzodiazepine‑related drugs and veterinary tranquilizers (xylazine, medetomidine), which dramatically increase the risk of life‑threatening respiratory depression. Naloxone reverses nitazene overdoses but multiple sequential doses are often required; continue to administer naloxone every 2–3 minutes until breathing improves and emergency help arrives. Because fentanyl test strips do not detect nitazenes, a negative FTS result does not rule them out; some jurisdictions now distribute nitazene‑specific strips, but availability and sensitivity vary. Due to sub‑milligram potency and uneven distribution in powders, never eyeball; if handling any powder, use an accurate milligram scale and volumetric dilution to reduce hot‑spot risk. Avoid using alone; ensure someone can monitor breathing, place the person in the recovery position if unresponsive, and call emergency services promptly at the first sign of overdose (slow/absent breathing, cyanosis, unresponsiveness). Avoid combining with any sedatives (alcohol, benzos, gabapentinoids) and beware that stimulants can mask overdose signs without reducing respiratory depression. Metonitazene’s half‑life in humans is not well-established; observe for re‑sedation (“re‑narcotization”) after naloxone and seek medical monitoring. Not clinically approved for medical use; first identified in the unregulated drug supply around 2021 and subsequently implicated in fatalities in multiple countries. ",

    "notes": "Flurazepam is rapidly absorbed but acts as a prodrug to N-desalkylflurazepam, which has a very long elimination half-life (roughly 47–100 hours), so effects can accumulate across nights and significantly impair next-day cognition, coordination, and reaction time. Driving impairment and increased accident risk are documented with benzodiazepines in general, and risk rises sharply if alcohol is also used; avoid driving or operating machinery not only the night of dosing but also the next day if residual sedation is present. Older adults eliminate benzodiazepines more slowly and face higher risks of falls, confusion, and amnesia; use the lowest dose possible and avoid long-acting hypnotics in this group where alternatives exist. Combining flurazepam with opioids or alcohol greatly increases the risk of life‑threatening respiratory depression; if any opioids are in use, do not take flurazepam and ensure naloxone availability in the household. Avoid combining with other CNS depressants such as GHB/GBL, barbiturates, or sedating antihistamines; even cannabis can meaningfully increase psychomotor impairment. People with pre‑existing respiratory disorders (e.g., OSA, COPD) are more susceptible to hypoventilation at sedative doses; medical oversight is advised, and flurazepam is generally a poor choice in these settings. Physical dependence can develop within weeks; never stop abruptly after repeated use—coordinate a slow, individualized taper with a clinician to mitigate severe withdrawal and seizure risk. In breastfeeding, flurazepam is generally not preferred due to long-acting metabolites and a report of infant sedation during multi‑drug exposure; if used, infants should be monitored for excessive drowsiness and poor feeding. In overdose, supportive care is first-line; flumazenil is typically avoided outside select scenarios because it can precipitate seizures—particularly in benzodiazepine‑tolerant patients or mixed TCA overdoses. Due to widespread circulation of counterfeit ‘benzodiazepine’ tablets (sometimes containing potent nitazene opioids), avoid non‑pharmacy sources; if exposure is possible, use drug‑checking services where available and never mix with depressants. Space doses by at least 24–48 hours and avoid ‘booster’ redoses at night; apparent early wear‑off can reflect redistribution, while the active metabolite persists and will compound next-day effects.",

    "notes": "Aminorex is an amphetamine-like anorectic withdrawn after an epidemic of drug-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); this adverse effect can be severe and long-lasting. PAH risk appears linked to aminorex-class agents and is the major reason to avoid frequent or high-dose use; symptoms such as exertional breathlessness, chest pain, syncope, or blue-tinged lips warrant urgent medical evaluation. Duration is long relative to perceived euphoria, increasing the temptation to redose; plan a single measured dose and avoid stacking. Historical German brand Menocil tablets reportedly contained 14 mg aminorex fumarate; if using laboratory material, be aware that fumarate vs freebase salts differ in potency by mass. Combining with other stimulants or serotonergics increases risks of hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation and, in susceptible cases, serotonin toxicity. Avoid use if you have cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, prior PAH, or unexplained exertional symptoms; consider baseline and follow-up blood pressure checks during any session. Insufflation accelerates onset and raises BP spikes and nasal injury risk; oral use is typically safer on the nose and less compulsive. Hydration, electrolyte intake, and temperature control reduce hyperthermia risk; avoid prolonged dancing/overheating and take cool-down breaks. Bruxism (jaw clenching/teeth grinding) is common with stimulants; a mouthguard or chewing gum reduces dental damage, and magnesium glycinate (200–400 mg/day) may help some users. Because human pharmacokinetic data for aminorex are sparse, treat all dosage ranges as estimates and titrate cautiously with a calibrated milligram scale or volumetric dosing. Do not use on consecutive days; leave multi-week gaps (e.g., several weeks or longer) to reduce tolerance and, more importantly, to limit cumulative cardiopulmonary risk. Keep total session dose modest and avoid binges that extend wakefulness beyond one night to reduce psychosis and cardiovascular complication risk.",

    "notes": "Mechanism: primarily inhibits norepinephrine and dopamine transporters; much weaker serotonin effects relative to NET/DAT, which guides interaction risk (e.g., less serotonergic liability than amphetamines). Start with the low end of dosing, particularly in stimulant-naïve users, and avoid redosing because the 10–13 h half-life produces prolonged cardiovascular stimulation. Baseline and on-day checks of blood pressure and heart rate reduce risk; discontinue and seek care with chest pain, severe headache, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Avoid use with MAOIs or within 14 days of MAOI exposure due to risk of hypertensive crisis; this is a general rule for sympathomimetics. Avoid combining with other stimulants (including OTC decongestants) to limit additive tachycardia and hypertension. In those on SNRIs or other noradrenergic agents (atomoxetine, bupropion, many TCAs), additive increases in BP/HR and anxiety are more likely; if co-prescribed medically, dose conservatively and monitor vitals. For SSRI users, serotonin toxicity risk appears lower than with serotonergic stimulants, but agitation, anxiety, and insomnia may be amplified—treat as a caution combination. Dose early in the day; avoid late-afternoon/evening dosing to minimize sleep disruption. Take with or without food; taking 1 hour before meals is common in labels, and food may reduce GI upset. Hepatic metabolism suggests added caution with significant liver disease. Typical adverse effects include insomnia, dry mouth, palpitations, anxiety, and decreased appetite; severe events are uncommon at therapeutic doses but have included arrhythmias in isolated cases. Stay hydrated and maintain nutrition given strong appetite suppression; prolonged caloric deficit can worsen side effects.",

Once-daily morning dosing was used clinically; avoid same-day redosing because active metabolites persist for 14–24 h and cumulatively load the cardiovascular system. Expect measurable increases in heart rate and small BP rises on average; stop and seek care for chest pain, severe headache, palpitations, or marked BP elevations. Risk of serotonin syndrome increases if combined with MAOIs or other serotonergic agents; do not use within 14 days of an MAOI and avoid serotonergic combinations. Sibutramine and/or analogs are frequently found adulterating “slimming” teas, coffees, and capsules; treat any such product as potentially mislabeled—use only products confirmed by accredited labs or avoid entirely. Rare cases of drug-induced liver injury have been reported; avoid if you have active liver disease and stop if you develop pruritus, dark urine, jaundice, or right‑upper‑quadrant pain. Because it can cause insomnia, dose early in the day and avoid other stimulants (including heavy caffeine); maintain hydration, particularly with exercise or hot environments. Metabolized mainly by CYP3A4; strong inhibitors may raise exposure and strong inducers may reduce efficacy—be cautious and monitor for BP/HR or adverse changes.

Mislabeling raises dosing risk; confirm with instrumental drug checking when possible.\n• PubChem lists entries for both dimethoxy α‑PVP and 3',4'-dimethoxy‑α‑PHP, supporting the presence of both scaffolds on the market; do not assume which you have based on vendor naming or reagent tests alone.\n• Reagent kits have limited specificity for cathinones; Liebermann/Simons patterns can suggest a cathinone but cannot distinguish ring/side‑chain variants—avoid making dosage decisions from reagents; use lab drug checking (GC/MS, LC‑MS).\n• As a pyrrolidinophenone, expected pharmacology is potent dopamine/norepinephrine transporter inhibition with minimal SERT activity; risks include tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction (cold extremities), anxiety/paranoia, hyperthermia and, at high/extended doses, rhabdomyolysis.\n• Acute management (medical setting): benzodiazepines are first‑line for sympathomimetic toxicity (agitation, hypertension, hyperthermia, seizures). External cooling for hyperthermia; avoid self‑treating stimulant symptoms with beta‑blockers without clinical oversight due to potential unopposed α‑effects.\n• Chronic/behavioral risks: strong craving/redosing loops, sleep deprivation, weight loss, depressive ‘crash’, and stimulant psychosis—risk increases with binges/multi‑day use, as seen with MDPV/α‑PVP cases.\n• Routes: oral has the gentlest profile; insufflation can increase BP/vasoconstriction and irritate sinuses; inhalation (vaporizing) causes very rapid spikes, harsh smoke, and the highest compulsion—prefer oral if using at all.\n• Harm reduction: use an accurate 1 mg‑resolution scale; consider volumetric dosing for sub‑10 mg accuracy. Plan a hard cap on total session dose and number of redoses; set a time limit. Keep cool, avoid strenuous activity, sip electrolytes, and schedule nutrition and sleep.\n• Polysubstance & mis-sold risks are common in the cathinone market (e.g., α‑PVP or NEP sold as ‘3‑MMC’). Use accredited drug‑checking services where available; start with allergy test doses from any new batch.\n• No human pharmacokinetic data for DMO‑PHP specifically; half‑life is inferred from related α‑PHP/α‑PVP analogs; large inter‑individual variability should be expected.",

    "notes": "• Identity and dose: MEM is rare; mislabeling is plausible. Use reagent testing or, if available, a drug-checking service before ingestion. Weigh doses with a calibrated 0.001 g (milligram) scale and avoid volumetric error. Allergy-test with 1–2 mg on a separate day to screen idiosyncratic reactions. Community and lab-note data support active oral dosing in the tens of milligrams; interindividual sensitivity varies notably. • Onset and redosing: Psychedelic amphetamines can have a slow come-up and very long plateau. Avoid redosing for at least 3 hours; premature redosing can produce an unexpectedly intense and prolonged experience. • Cardiovascular load: Phenethylamine psychedelics may increase heart rate and blood pressure and can cause peripheral vasoconstriction. Those with cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension should avoid use. Seek urgent care if chest pain, severe headache, confusion, or a temperature >39.5°C (103.1°F) develops. • Serotonergic/stimulant interactions: Do not combine with MAOIs (risk of hypertensive crisis or serotonin toxicity). Avoid mixing with tramadol or DXM (both lower seizure threshold/serotonergic), and avoid lithium or tricyclic antidepressants due to reports of life-threatening seizures when such agents are combined with serotonergic psychedelics. • Mental health: Strong psychedelics can precipitate or exacerbate anxiety, panic, psychosis, and mania in vulnerable individuals. People with a personal or family history of psychotic disorders or bipolar disorder should avoid use. • Setting and supervision: Use in a safe environment with a trusted, sober sitter; plan for 16–24 hours without responsibilities, driving, or operating machinery, plus an aftercare window for rest and nutrition. • Hydration/temperature: Maintain normal hydration and temperature; avoid strenuous activity and hot environments to reduce hyperthermia risk during stimulation. • Sleep/recovery: Expect sleep disruption the night after; schedule recovery time. • Frequency/tolerance: Cross-tolerance occurs with other psychedelics. Spacing sessions by at least 1–2 weeks (preferably longer) reduces tolerance build-up and psychological strain. • Unknown toxicology: Human pharmacokinetics and long-term safety are uncharacterized. Conservative dosing and avoidance of poly-drug use are key.",

    "notes": "Identity/purity uncertainty: DPP‑26 is very new to the grey market; vendors have reportedly copied potency claims from dipipanone. Submit samples to a drug‑checking service when possible, and assume unknown potency until lab‑verified. Large variability in active dose has been reported within and between batches. Severe nasal causticity has been described with insufflation; users reported intense burn and irritation. From a harm‑reduction standpoint, avoid IN and especially IV routes; oral is the least risky ROA for uncertain powders. At least one user reported injection burning on a miss and only partial solubility until heating; sterile technique and proper filtration cannot eliminate unknown excipients or caustic pH risks. Compared to methiodone/IC‑26 and dipipanone, several reports describe a quicker onset than methiodone but shorter overall duration (~6–10 h), with prominent sedation and modest euphoria. Redose conservatively and wait at least 3 hours after any meaningful oral dose because peaks can be delayed; stacking increases overdose risk. Co‑use with other depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, GHB/GBL, gabapentinoids) markedly increases the risk of respiratory depression and fatal overdose; avoid these combinations. Potentiation by antihistamines has a history of serious harm: cyclizine can intensify opioid effects and has been linked to dangerous practices with dipipanone mixtures; avoid sedating antihistamines with DPP‑26. Methadone and some opioids can prolong QT; it is unknown if DPP‑26 does, but until pharmacology is characterized, avoid concurrent QT‑prolonging drugs/electrolyte disturbances and seek medical advice if you have cardiac risk factors. Carry naloxone and ensure others know how to use it; sedation can persist into the next day. Expect typical opioid adverse effects: constipation, pruritus, miosis, nausea; mitigate constipation proactively and avoid driving or hazardous work the day of dosing and until completely alert. Immunoassay cross‑reactivity with methadone panels is unknown; given structural similarity to methiodone/dipipanone analogues, a false positive for methadone cannot be excluded; confirmatory testing (GC‑MS/LC‑MS) would be needed.",

Have a trusted sober sitter for first trials. - DOx insufflation significantly increases risk (rapid spikes, nasal injury); oral is the safer route for titration.",

    "notes": "3-FPM is a phenmetrazine analogue; like phenmetrazine it appears to act primarily on dopamine and norepinephrine systems with minimal direct serotonin releasing activity reported, which lowers—but does not eliminate—serotonin syndrome concerns when used alone. However, cardiovascular and neurobehavioral risks typical of stimulants still apply, especially with redosing. Erowid and community reports emphasize strong 'more-ish' qualities and that vaped or insufflated routes are particularly compulsive; pre-planning maximum total dose and avoiding short-interval redoses can reduce harms. Nasal administration is notably caustic and can acutely damage mucosa; if used, finely crush, keep lines small, alternate nostrils, rinse with sterile saline before/after, and allow multi‑day healing intervals to prevent erosions or septal injury. Batch-to-batch variability and adulteration have been reported; where available, use a certified drug checking service and be skeptical of off‑white/pink or gritty material, unexpected residues on heating, or weak effects at typical doses. Combining with alcohol or other stimulants meaningfully increases heart rate, blood pressure, and vasoconstriction; this can raise risks of chest pain, palpitations, and overheating—avoid such mixes and monitor exertion and ambient temperature. Hydration and nutrition matter: sip water regularly (about 250 ml per hour at rest, up to 500 ml per hour if active) and include electrolytes after several hours; eat a balanced meal before use to mitigate appetite suppression and comedown fatigue. Sleep debt strongly worsens anxiety and low mood on the comedown; plan sufficient sleep opportunity, and avoid consecutive‑day use to limit tolerance and compulsion. Pharmacokinetic data for 3‑FPM are sparse; phenmetrazine (the parent drug) has a long half‑life (16–31 h), but 3‑FPM subjectively feels shorter; residual stimulation into the next day can still occur after high or repeated dosing. Given variable market quality, be alert for unexpected effects (e.g., unusual sedation or very long duration) that may indicate mislabeling or cuts; discontinue and consider checking the sample if this occurs. People with hypertension, arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease, or significant anxiety disorders should avoid use or seek medical guidance; stimulants increase cardiac workload and can exacerbate anxiety and bruxism.",

    "notes": "- BZ is an extremely potent, long‑acting muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist intended historically as a military incapacitating agent; “sub‑milligram” amounts can cause days‑long delirium, amnesia, ataxia, and severe disorientation. This is not a recreational drug and exposure should be considered a medical risk scenario.\n- Onset is delayed (commonly 2–4 hours), which strongly increases the temptation to redose; redosing substantially raises the risk of prolonged incapacitation, heat injury, urinary retention, and hospitalization. Avoid any redosing.\n- BZ markedly impairs sweating and heat dissipation (mydriasis, anhidrosis), creating a real risk of hyperthermia even at ambient temperatures; if exposure occurs, remain in a cool environment, remove excess clothing, use passive cooling, and seek medical evaluation for high temperature, agitation, or muscle rigidity.\n- Vision is often severely affected (extreme mydriasis, blurred near focus) for 1–3 days or more—do not drive, cycle, swim, or engage in any hazardous activity until vision and cognition are clearly normal.\n- Hydration is important but should be supervised; anticholinergics can cause both dry mouth and urinary retention. If unable to void for 6–8 hours with suprapubic discomfort, seek urgent care—catheterization may be required.\n- In suspected anticholinergic toxicity, first‑line hospital care is supportive: cooling, IV fluids, electrolyte/CK monitoring, and cautious benzodiazepines for severe agitation. Physostigmine (a tertiary acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) can rapidly reverse delirium in pure anticholinergic toxidrome but must only be administered in a monitored medical setting due to seizure/bradyarrhythmia risk and is contraindicated in TCA co‑ingestion or QRS widening. Do not attempt any antidotes outside a hospital.\n- Combining BZ with other anticholinergics (sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine, TCAs, anticholinergic antipsychotics/antiemetics) markedly increases toxicity (confusion, hyperthermia, ileus, urinary retention). Alcohol, Z‑drugs, and opioids further impair judgement and breathing, compounding injury and aspiration risk. Stimulants may worsen agitation, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis risk.\n- Due to dose variability and idiosyncratic responses, “test dosing” is unsafe here: incapacitating IM doses are on the order of 6–8 µg/kg, and Erowid reports that <1 mg orally can cause profound effects for days.\n- Tolerance data are limited. Military reports describe “second‑dose effects” 2–4 weeks after an initial exposure with faster onset and heightened peaks; repeated exposure increases unpredictability rather than safety. Cross‑tolerance with other antimuscarinics is plausible but unquantified.\n- People with narrow‑angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy/urinary obstruction, ileus, tachyarrhythmias, severe cardiovascular disease, or cognitive disorders, as well as children and older adults, are at elevated risk from anticholinergic toxicity; any suspected exposure warrants professional assessment.\n- Mechanistically, BZ binds with very high affinity in the orthosteric pocket of muscarinic receptors; slow dissociation helps explain prolonged central effects even when plasma levels fall.\n- Legal/forensic note: BZ is listed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (Schedule 2). Civilian availability is rare; unexpected “BZ” representations are often misidentifications of other anticholinergics.\n- If someone seems intoxicated: do not leave them alone; prevent access to heat, water bodies, traffic, or weapons; avoid physical confrontation; call emergency services if there is fever, severe agitation, confusion, chest pain, seizure, inability to urinate, or loss of consciousness.",

    "notes": "HARM REDUCTION RATIONALES (evidence-backed): 1) Identity and potency are often uncertain in the cathinone market and mislabeling is common; pyrrolidinophenones like α‑PVP are frequently found in products sold as other cathinones. Prefer GC/MS drug checking where available; field reagents can only ‘rule in/out’ and cannot confirm identity or purity. Start with a very low test dose. Evidence: Saferparty drug-checking warnings documenting frequent cathinone mislabeling, including α‑PVP substituted for 3‑MMC/4‑MMC; and Erowid’s drug checking guidance stating reagents do not confirm identity. 2) Acute medical risks for substituted cathinones include tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation, seizures, and rhabdomyolysis with potential kidney injury. Avoid physical exertion and hot environments; actively manage temperature (cool environment, rest) and use small, spaced doses. Evidence: clinical/HR review for synthetic cathinones summarizing ED presentations (high neurologic/cardiovascular involvement) and rhabdomyolysis reports. 3) Psychosis and severe anxiety/paranoia are more likely with high doses, frequent redosing, and sleep deprivation. Plan session length, avoid overnight binges, and stop redosing early enough to allow sleep (consider sleep hygiene rather than stacking depressants). Evidence: α‑PVP experience categories on Erowid highlighting ‘Addiction & Habituation’ and ‘Health Problems’; Drugs‑Forum psychosis overview. 4) Compulsive redosing is common with pyrrolidinophenones. Pre-portion doses, lock away the remainder, and set timers (e.g., ≥2–3 h between doses); consider end‑time and a single redose cap. Evidence: numerous α‑PVP user reports describing binges and difficulty stopping. 5) Avoid ‘speedballing’ (stimulants with opioids) and mixing with other stimulants; MAOI combinations are high‑risk (hypertensive crisis). Use TripSit combination guidance for conservative defaults. Evidence: TripSit combination chart guidance and HR materials. 6) Nasal use is often irritating/corrosive; use your own equipment, consider saline rinses afterward, and avoid frequent lines to reduce epistaxis and mucosal damage. Evidence: Saferparty HR advisories for sniffing hygiene. 7) Hydration should be moderate with electrolytes (avoid both dehydration and overhydration). Monitor urine color and body temperature; dark urine, severe muscle pain/rigidity, or confusion warrant urgent medical care. Evidence: cathinone toxicity reviews citing hyperthermia/rhabdomyolysis. 8) Vaping/smoking is reported by some but is associated anecdotally with harsh pulmonary irritation and difficult‑to‑control dosing; avoid inhalational ROAs especially with unknown batch identity. Evidence: Bluelight/Reddit user reports for MDPHP/4F‑PHP noting cough/irritation; no safety data. 9) Use an accurate milligram scale or volumetric solutions; do not eyeball. Evidence: general HR best practice and frequent mislabeling/potency variability documented by drug checking services. 10) Given uncertain serotonergic activity across mislabeled ‘4F‑PHP’ products, be cautious with serotonergic agents (SSRIs/SNRIs, DXM, tramadol) and watch for serotonin toxicity signs even if risk is low with strictly dopaminergic/noradrenergic cathinones. Evidence: cathinone clinical reviews and TripSit combinations. Citations at end.",

    "notes": "Evidence from the EU Early Warning System shows furanylfentanyl has been sold as powders and liquids, including ready‑to‑use nasal sprays and e‑liquids, which can deliver unpredictable doses and increase overdose risk due to concentration errors and non‑uniform mixing. Carry naloxone and be prepared to give repeat doses: synthetic opioids often require redosing every 2–5 minutes and larger total amounts to restore breathing; the aim is ventilation, not full arousal, and medical help should be called immediately. Naloxone will not reverse the effects of non‑opioid adulterants such as xylazine or medetomidine, both of which have been frequently found alongside fentanyl‑class opioids; persistent heavy sedation after naloxone suggests these may be present and requires airway support and monitoring until help arrives. Fentanyl test strips can detect fentanyl and certain analogues at very low levels but are binary only and can give false positives or false negatives depending on sample composition and preparation; follow manufacturer or local drug‑checking instructions and do not assume a negative result means safety. Drug‑checking programs regularly find veterinary tranquilizers (xylazine, medetomidine), benzodiazepine‑related drugs, and multiple high‑potency opioids co‑present in expected fentanyl samples; co‑use greatly increases risk of respiratory depression and prolonged sedation. Because psychoactive doses are in the microgram range, volumetric dosing is strongly preferred over attempting to weigh single doses; use appropriately dilute solutions and labeled containers to reduce dosing error risk. Avoid using alone, avoid rapid redosing during the first 30–45 minutes, and be aware that re‑narcotization can occur after naloxone wears off (30–90 minutes), especially with long‑acting co‑depressants. Ready‑made nasal sprays purchased online or self‑prepared from powders have been seized in Europe; without analytical confirmation, assume concentration may vary bottle‑to‑bottle and within a bottle. Practice basic respiratory first aid during suspected overdose (rescue breaths while awaiting naloxone effect), and continue monitoring due to frequent polydrug contamination in current supplies. Treat any white powder or pressed tablet as potentially containing fentanyl‑class substances; test a small, well‑dissolved sample when possible and start with a sub‑threshold microdose to assess sensitivity.",

Many users report active insufflated doses in the single‑digit to low‑tens of milligrams, indicating very high potency; this makes microgram‑accurate weighing and preferably volumetric dosing essential to avoid accidental overdosing. Supply‑side confusion between tilmetamine and tiletamine has been frequently discussed; at least one set of lab results confirmed high‑purity tilmetamine in two separate samples, yet users still described starkly different effect profiles, so mislabeling cannot alone explain all adverse reactions—expect idiosyncratic responses. Redosing during the same day or on consecutive days is repeatedly associated with markedly worse and longer‑lasting adverse effects (notably whole‑body tremor, fine‑motor impairment, and vestibular disturbances), sometimes lasting days to weeks; avoid binges and space trials by at least several weeks. Several reports describe exacerbation of tremor/anxiety when combined with serotonergic medications (SSRIs, buspirone) or taken while recently on them; given the unknown pharmacology, treat serotonergic co‑use as a risk factor and avoid combinations. People have reported prolonged disequilibrium and vision/focus issues (e.g., delayed accommodation, visual static) that impair driving and fine tasks—do not drive for at least 24–48 hours after moderate–high use and until fully normal. If considering injection routes, be aware that small parenteral doses produced disproportionately strong effects in reports; due to unknown excipients, sterility risks, and the potential for severe neurologic after‑effects, IM/IV use is strongly discouraged outside clinical settings. Use GC/MS‑based drug checking where available to confirm identity and assess purity; reagent kits are of limited value for arylcyclohexylamines and cannot ensure safety. Store in airtight, light‑protected containers with desiccant to limit potential oxidative degradation of sulfur‑containing analogs; avoid heat. In an emergency (severe agitation, psychosis, chest pain, intractable vomiting, or disabling tremor/vertigo), seek medical care; do not attempt to self‑treat with random prescriptions (especially antipsychotics), and disclose that an unknown dissociative may have been used.",

    "notes": "Identity and potency are uncertain in the unregulated market; MDPM has been explicitly marketed as an MDMA substitute on forums, so do not assume contents—use multi-reagent testing and, where available, lab drug checking to confirm identity before any bioassay. Avoid repeating the claim that MDPM is a typical MDMA synthesis impurity; available community evidence points instead to intentional sale as its own product, not a routine MDMA by-product. Onset can be slower than expected for a stimulant (especially orally), which encourages premature redosing—wait at least 90–120 minutes before considering more to avoid accidental overuse. Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, increased blood pressure) is possible; people with uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, or cardiovascular disease should avoid use. Stay cool, take rest breaks, and sip isotonic fluids (avoid both dehydration and overhydration). General stimulant HR supports these measures. Intranasal use can irritate/damage nasal mucosa; if snorting, finely powder, split lines, and use pre/post isotonic saline rinses; consider oral as a lower-harm ROA. Combining with MAOIs, tramadol, or DXM elevates serotonin-toxicity and seizure risks; avoid these combinations entirely. Use extra caution with SSRIs/SNRIs (possible blunting or unpredictable interactions). TripSit’s combo guidance and HR pages support avoiding serotonergic/stimulant risk stacks. Sleep disruption is common; plan ahead, avoid late redoses, and favor non-alcoholic comedown strategies (nutrition, hydration, sleep hygiene; consider OTC sleep aids like melatonin only if appropriate). Pharmacokinetic data in humans are lacking; any in vitro ‘half-life’ figures should not guide dosing. Treat half-life as unknown and dose conservatively, leaving long gaps between sessions. Some users report mild empathic warmth rather than classic MDMA-like entactogenesis; expectations should be set accordingly to reduce risky redosing in search of absent effects. If using regularly, schedule long breaks (weeks) to limit tolerance and dependence; stimulant binges increase risks of psychosis and compulsive redosing as seen with other stimulants. ",

    "notes": "Name/identity: This compound has been sold as “Modafiendz” and discussed as N‑methyl‑4,4'-difluoromodafinil; there is no peer‑reviewed human PK/toxicology, and marketed products may contain variable or mislabelled actives. User reports range from minimal effects to notable palpitations, highlighting batch inconsistency and possible adulteration or degradation. If the analogue shares modafinil’s liabilities, rare but serious cutaneous reactions (e.g., SJS/TEN/DRESS) are a concern; discontinue immediately at any rash or mucosal symptoms. Modafinil‑like CYP effects (3A4 induction; 2C19 inhibition) can meaningfully alter other drugs (e.g., methadone, diazepam) and potentially reduce effectiveness of some hormonal contraceptives—use extra protection while using and for weeks after, pending more data. Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, BP elevation) and anxiety are reported; those with heart disease, arrhythmia history, or panic disorders should avoid or use only with medical oversight. Residual wakefulness can impair sleep architecture for 6–12 h after offset; avoid late dosing and plan sleep hygiene. Avoid combining with other stimulants or high caffeine to limit BP/HR spikes and jitteriness. Do not snort or inject: modafinil‑class compounds are poorly water soluble and not formulated for non‑oral routes; non‑oral use increases harm without added benefit. Due to frequent mislabeling in the unregulated market, consider drug checking where available; basic reagents are not definitive for this class, but MS‑based services can confirm composition. Until human data exist, treat all dosing guidance as provisional and titrate cautiously.",

Community reports consistently describe a narrow comfort window: low–moderate oral doses (≈10–50 mg) feel functional with mild euphoria, while higher/redosed amounts increase anxiety, vasoconstriction, tremor, and sweaty tunnel‑vision. Insufflation is commonly described as harsh on nasal mucosa with a sharper, shorter effect and more peripheral side‑effects; oral is favored for smoother onset. Users frequently remark on sexual arousal/pro‑sociality, compulsive redosing, and insomnia if taken late; repeating 40–60 mg oral doses the same day markedly worsens comedown discomfort. Structural and experiential similarity to pyrrolidine stimulants supports cross‑tolerance with α‑PVP/pyrovalerone‑like agents, though prolintane lacks the β‑keto group and tends to be milder/shorter. HR: identify substances via reagent/lab testing where available; dose accurately with a milligram scale; avoid late‑night redoses; monitor blood pressure/heart rate; maintain fluids and electrolytes; allow multi‑day breaks to reduce tolerance and compulsion; prefer oral route; avoid stimulant stacking and MAOIs; and treat unexpected chest pain, severe headache, or agitation as a medical issue.

    "notes": "Identity: α‑PCYP is a pyrrolidinophenone cathinone; structural identifiers (InChIKey FKEHRWJWTWDTDB) are cataloged by chemistry databases and compendia, confirming nomenclature and class. This backs using class-based harm reduction where substance-specific data are sparse. Route risks: Snorting cathinones is frequently linked to significant nasal and throat irritation and chemical burns; oral routes are typically less damaging to mucosa. Users often report harshness when vaporizing α‑PCYP or similar pyrrolidinophenones. Prefer oral, avoid vaporizing, and if insufflating, use sterile tools and saline care. Compulsive use/psychosis: Cathinones—especially pyrrolidinophenones like α‑PVP—are consistently associated with compulsive redosing, insomnia, paranoia and psychotic episodes. Set strict limits, schedule sleep, and stop at early warning signs (racing thoughts, overheating, suspicious ideation). Cardiovascular strain/overheating: Stimulants raise heart rate and temperature; combining with other stimulants heightens risk. Keep cool, rest periodically, and hydrate modestly (about 250 ml/hour at rest, up to ~500 ml/hour if active). Avoid heavy exertion in hot settings. Drug checking: Mislabeling within the pyrrolidinophenone market is well documented (e.g., α‑PVP sold as 3‑MMC; α‑PiHP sold as 2C‑B). Use accredited drug checking when possible; note FTIR’s ~5% detection limit—trace adulterants may be missed—so single tests can be misleading. Start with very small doses even after testing. Polydrug caution: Alcohol and sedatives can increase risky behavior and mask stimulant intoxication; ‘balancing’ uppers and downers raises overdose/accident risk. If severe agitation, chest pain, or hyperthermia occur, seek medical help; do not self‑treat with more substances. Limited evidence base: Human pharmacokinetics for α‑PCYP are uncharacterized; most info comes from community reports and forensic listings. Treat all dose/duration figures as rough; individual variability is high. ",

MDPV’s duration is short-to-moderate, but residual stimulation and insomnia can persist up to 48 h, and redosing greatly extends both duration and adverse effects. Polydrug use with MAOIs can precipitate hypertensive crises due to catecholamine excess; avoid completely. Combining with other stimulants markedly elevates cardiovascular and psychosis risks. Depressant combinations (alcohol, opioids) raise crash/overdose and heart-strain risks; if a benzodiazepine is used to manage overstimulation, avoid any other depressants and use the minimum effective amount. Psychosis, hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis have been documented in severe intoxication and binges; rapid cooling, fluids and medical care are critical warning thresholds. Injection and inhalation have been linked to severe toxicity and at least one fatality; these routes also strongly increase compulsive redosing—avoid. Misrepresentation in the market is common across cathinones; drug checking can detect substitutions (e.g., MDPPP sold as 3‑MMC); start low and wait at least 2 h before redosing if oral. Immunoassay urine screens may cross‑react (false‑positive PCP has been reported); confirmatory testing (GC/MS) resolves this. Nasal harm reduction: use clean, personal equipment; alternate nostrils; rinse with saline afterward to reduce tissue damage.",

    "notes": "Evidence-based harm-reduction additions and corrections (reasoning and citations below): 1) Dosage correction: PIHKAL associates 2C‑N with much higher oral doses than originally listed. Community bioassays report noticeable to fully psychedelic effects at ~100–130 mg (HCl salt), with 60 mg nitrate described as mild. The prior 8–30 mg range risks underdosing and confusing 2C‑N with far more potent NBOMe analogs; corrected to 90–130 mg common range with conservative lower bands. 2) Salt-form potency: One Erowid report explicitly notes the nitrate salt is ~9% less potent than HCl; while anecdotal, users should account for salt mass when weighing. 3) Short duration: Reports consistently describe a shorter total timeline (≈3–5 hours at typical doses), so duration was tightened to 3–6 hours with rapid onset at higher doses. 4) Interaction specifics: TripSit’s combination guidance for 2C‑x supports listing MAOIs as ‘dangerous’, tramadol as ‘unsafe’ (seizure risk), and stimulants/caffeine as cautionary due to cardiovascular and anxiety load; SSRIs/SNRIs may attenuate or unpredictably alter effects. 5) Insufflation caution: Across 2C‑x, insufflation is commonly very painful with greater side effects; oral dosing is strongly preferred for safety and comfort. 6) Misidentification risk: 2C‑N is rare; NBOMes/NBOHs on blotter or as potent sub‑mg powders are sometimes sold as ‘2C‑x’. NBOMes are active at microgram doses and have been linked to medical emergencies; always test and avoid unknown blotters as ‘2C‑N’. 7) Legal risk (U.S.): 2C‑N was added to Schedule I in July 2012, creating substantial legal penalties for possession/distribution. 8) Tolerance: Classic 5‑HT2A psychedelics rapidly produce tolerance within days with cross‑tolerance across LSD/psilocybin/mescaline/DOx; spacing uses by ~10–14 days reduces unpredictable responses. 9) Phenethylamine body load: Some users report mild GI upset, stimulation, or vasoconstriction; avoid combining with vasoconstrictive stimulants and monitor hydration and temperature. 10) Data scarcity: Human data are limited; individual variability is high; start low, weigh accurately, and prefer oral administration.",

    "notes": "• The majority of catastrophic harms reported with “krokodil” are linked to impure, highly acidic home‑cooked mixtures containing iodine, red phosphorus by‑products, phosphoramides, and other corrosives; these contaminants—not pharmaceutical desomorphine itself—drive tissue necrosis, phlebitis, osteomyelitis, and systemic infections. Laboratory and clinical reviews consistently attribute the extreme local damage to these by‑products. Keep expectations realistic: harm reduction cannot fully mitigate risks from unknown, caustic mixtures.\n• If injecting any opioid, markedly reduce risk by using sterile water, new sterile equipment each time, and a 0.22 μm wheel filter (PVDF/nylon) to remove particulates and many bacteria; avoid using cotton/cigarette filters. Avoid IM/SQ (“muscling/skin‑popping”), which carries especially high risk of abscess and necrosis with contaminated solutions. Rotate sites; never share supplies. These steps are standard HR practice and particularly critical with suspected krokodil.\n• Rapid onset with short duration increases redose compulsion; plan doses in advance, avoid stacking, and use milligram‑accurate scales. Test allergy sensitivity with a very small fraction of an intended dose if opioid‑naïve or uncertain potency. Community and historical medical sources describe substantially higher potency than morphine by IV, underscoring overdose risk at mg/sub‑mg errors.\n• Overdose risks: profound respiratory depression may peak early and can outlast perceived euphoria. Do not use alone; have naloxone present and someone trained to respond (rescue breathing, emergency services). Be aware of renarcotization: naloxone works 30–90 min; effects may wear off while the opioid persists—monitor for recurrence and repeat dosing as needed.\n• Adulteration alert: opioid supplies in many cities frequently contain benzos (e.g., bromazolam), xylazine, and multiple high‑potency opioids (fluorofentanyl, nitazenes). These combinations blunt naloxone’s effect on sedation (xylazine) and increase overdose severity. Utilize drug‑checking services where available; if using test strips, remember fentanyl strips do not detect xylazine/benzos.\n• Prefer non‑injecting ROAs (e.g., oral) when possible; if injecting, aim for near‑neutral pH and fully dissolved, filtered solutions; never inject turbid/colored mixtures. Seek prompt wound care for redness, swelling, warmth, severe pain, fever, or streaking—these are infection warning signs.\n• Tolerance escalates rapidly with frequent dosing; physical dependence can develop within days. Plan spacing and consider opioid agonist therapy if daily use emerges. Keep constipation prevention in mind (hydration, fiber/osmotic laxatives) and avoid driving/operating machinery during and after use due to prolonged sedation.\n• Supply reality: genuine, pharmaceutical‑grade desomorphine (e.g., historic Permonid) is almost never encountered; most “krokodil” reports involve crude, variable products with desomorphine sometimes only a minor component. Dose assumptions are therefore highly unreliable. ",

    "notes": "Product mislabeling and salt-form variability are common in the benzofuran market; material sold as “Benzo Fury” may contain 5‑APB, 6‑APB, mixtures, or unrelated actives—use multi-reagent testing and consider sending a small sample to a drug-checking service before dosing. The come-up can be slow (often 60–120 min) with a wave-like rise; premature redosing in the first 2–3 hours markedly increases risk of over-intoxication, nausea, and cardiovascular strain. 5‑APB is commonly encountered as the HCl or succinate salt; by weight, HCl contains more active base than succinate—doses should be reduced if the material is HCl or unusually pure. Reagent behavior can resemble MDMA on some tests (e.g., Marquis/Mecke dark reactions), so use a panel (e.g., Froehde, Simon’s) rather than a single reagent and avoid assuming MDMA results confirm MDMA. As a serotonergic entactogen with stimulant properties, 5‑APB should not be combined with MAOIs, DXM, tramadol, triptans, or serotonergic supplements (5‑HTP) due to serotonin toxicity risk; combining with other stimulants amplifies hypertension, hyperthermia, and arrhythmia risk. Benzofurans show concerning 5‑HT2B activity in vitro discussions; although clinical data are limited, frequent use may pose a theoretical valvulopathy risk—pace use (e.g., several weeks between sessions) and avoid if you have heart disease. Manage environment and temperature: take breaks from heat, sip water regularly, and include electrolytes on long sessions; avoid heavy alcohol (dehydration, masking warning signs). Common adverse effects include jaw clenching, nausea/vomiting on come-up, headaches during/after, insomnia, and transient anxiety—dose control, cool ambient temperature, and avoiding redose can mitigate these. Insufflation is irritating and may increase intensity but reduce duration; oral administration is generally preferred for smoother effects. Cross-tolerance with MDMA/MDA and similar entactogens is reported; spacing uses reduces “muted” effects and post-acute low mood. Because benzo fury-era products were often adulterated, be cautious with pressed pellets or unusually colored powders, and titrate with an accurate milligram scale after reagent testing.",

    "notes": "Eutylone has repeatedly turned up as a mis-sold substitute for MDMA in real-world markets; visual similarity and overlapping early effects can mislead users—drug checking is essential before use. Reported experiences emphasize that euphoria may be brief while residual stimulation and insomnia can last many hours, increasing temptation to redose and raising harm. Reagent testing can help flag non‑MDMA cathinones: compared to MDMA’s classic Marquis purple/black, cathinones like eutylone may show weak yellow/orange reactions and can fizz; confirm with multiple reagents and, where available, use spectroscopy-based drug checking. Oral dosing is generally gentler and longer than insufflation; nasal use is commonly reported as painful with harsh drip and more compulsive redosing. Avoid redosing late in the session—each top‑up tends to extend insomnia and exacerbate anxiety/headache rather than restore early euphoria. As with other stimulants, overheating and dehydration are risks in warm or high-exertion settings; take breaks, stay cool, and sip fluids regularly without overhydrating. Combining with MAOIs or stacking multiple stimulants/serotonergics materially increases risks (hypertension, hyperthermia, serotonin toxicity, seizures). If severe agitation, chest pain, confusion, very high temperature, or persistent vomiting occur, seek urgent medical care and be honest about substances taken. Post‑use aftercare (food with carbs/protein, electrolytes, sleep hygiene, and a low‑stimulation environment) can soften the comedown; consider spacing use by several weeks to allow sleep and mood to normalize. People with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, seizure history, or anxiety disorders appear at elevated risk and should avoid use.",

    "notes": "Identity and class: Butylone is a substituted cathinone closely related to methylone; both act at monoamine transporters and can release serotonin, with butylone generally described as milder and more stimulating than MDMA. Pharmacology: In vitro work shows butylone inhibits DAT/NET/SERT and can induce 5‑HT release (MDMA‑like), supporting risks typical of serotonergic stimulants (e.g., hyperthermia, serotonin toxicity when combined inappropriately). Duration and dosing are highly variable between batches; begin with an allergy test and use a calibrated milligram scale. Avoid redosing early: peaks can be short and redose compulsion is common in cathinones, increasing cardiovascular strain, anxiety, and next‑day crash. Overheating and dehydration are key risks under hot/crowded conditions; take cooling breaks, avoid heavy exertion, sip 250–500 mL water per hour if dancing (less if sedentary), and avoid overhydration (alternate water with small electrolyte intake). Serotonin syndrome risk increases with MAOIs, DXM, tramadol, and other serotonergic combinations; seek urgent care if high fever, confusion, clonus, or severe agitation occurs. Insufflation causes pronounced nasal irritation and disproportionate side effects per user reports; oral administration is typically preferred for harm reduction. Adulteration/mis‑selling is common in stimulant markets and MDMA pills/powders may contain cathinones; use reagent/drug‑checking services where available before ingestion. People with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, seizure history, or on serotonergic or pro‑convulsant medications should avoid use.

    "notes": "Dimethylpentylone is a novel, tertiary-amine substituted cathinone that appears on the unregulated market under vague names like “KU crystals,” often mis-sold as empathogens such as 3‑MMC or even MDMA; drug checking programs have detected dimethylpentylone in samples sold as 3‑MMC, highlighting the need for lab testing before dosing. This compound’s potency and effect profile seem highly variable across batches, with community reports describing modest stimulation at low doses, a moreish redose pattern, and prolonged residual stimulation that can extend insomnia into the next day; plan doses conservatively, avoid chasing effects, and set a firm no‑redose cutoff several hours before intended sleep. Like other cathinones and stimulants, risks include tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, anxiety, and agitation; these are exacerbated by hot environments and strenuous activity—maintain breaks from dancing, sip electrolytes regularly, and monitor for overheating. Combining with serotonergic medicines (SSRIs/SNRIs/MAOIs) or pro‑serotonergic OTC drugs (e.g., DXM) increases the risk of serotonin toxicity; tramadol and bupropion further add seizure risk—avoid these mixes and seek medical help if you develop clonus, hyperthermia, confusion, or severe agitation. Insufflation can cause substantial nasal burning and tissue irritation similar to other cathinones; limit frequency, avoid caustic re-doses, and rinse the nose with sterile saline after sessions. Avoid “stimulant + depressant” cycles (e.g., alcohol, opioids, heavy benzodiazepine doses) to come down, as sedation may outlast stimulation and lead to respiratory depression or dangerous intoxication when judgment is impaired—use non‑sedative sleep hygiene instead and keep benzodiazepines as emergency-only under supervision. Given frequent mislabeling, don’t rely on reagent kits alone; use accredited drug checking where possible and treat unfamiliar crystals or powders as higher risk until confirmed. ",

    "notes": "Key harm-reduction considerations and rationale (evidence lines include summaries from clinical/animal toxicology, case compilations, and large experience repositories): 1) Delayed onset with very long duration raises redosing and impairment risks — effects often begin 2–7 h after ingestion, peak near 8–12 h, and can last 24–36 h with after-effects up to 72 h, so redosing within the first 8–12 h substantially increases the chance of severe dysphoria and toxic effects; driving or operating machinery should be avoided for at least the remainder of the day and often the next day. 2) Potency varies widely between seeds and powders; essential oil is far more concentrated — composition differences (myristicin, elemicin, safrole, terpenes) and storage/freshness lead to unpredictable strength; pre-ground supermarket spice can be weaker or stale, while fresh whole seed and essential oil can be much stronger; essential oil ingestion has been associated with more severe toxicity (including seizures) and is not recommended. 3) Clinical toxidrome commonly includes anticholinergic-like symptoms (dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention), tachycardia, flushing, agitation, confusion, and sometimes paranoia or frank delirium; management is supportive and effects usually resolve within 24–48+ h. 4) Historical and toxicology sources implicate allylbenzenes; myristicin itself is a major component of nutmeg/mace oils; myristicin’s exact contribution to human psychotropic effects remains uncertain, but toxicology programs studied it because of broad exposure and structural similarity to other flavoring alkenylbenzenes with toxic potential in rodents. 5) Pregnancy/lactation: avoid doses above culinary use — nutmeg/mace oils are GRAS for food amounts, but high doses can produce anticholinergic symptoms and there is historical concern for abortifacient potential; LactMed advises avoiding amounts above flavoring doses during breastfeeding. 6) Liver prudence: while myristicin’s carcinogenicity in humans is unproven, related alkenylbenzenes (e.g., safrole, methyleugenol) show hepatotoxic/carcinogenic signals in rodents; avoid combining large nutmeg doses with alcohol or other hepatotoxic exposures and avoid repeated use. 7) Practical HR: weigh doses with a scale; start low on a separate day with nothing else onboard; do not redose the same day; plan a low-stimulus setting, temperature control, and passive hydration (small, regular sips; avoid extreme over- or underhydration); monitor for chest pain, fever, severe confusion, seizures, or urinary retention — seek urgent care if these occur; avoid in children and in people with cardiovascular disease, urinary retention history, glaucoma, severe psychiatric vulnerability, or pregnancy.\n\nEvidence/citations supporting the above points are listed in the citations field.",

    "notes": "Norflurazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine metabolite (of flurazepam and quazepam, among others); metabolite data indicate an elimination half-life roughly 47–100 hours, so doses can accumulate over days and cause next‑day impairment even when the primary ‘high’ has faded. This makes conservative initial dosing and avoiding redosing within 24 hours especially important. Co-use with opioids or alcohol markedly raises overdose risk through synergistic respiratory depression; many emergency department analyses show worse outcomes when benzodiazepines are combined with either opioids or alcohol. Unregulated markets frequently contain benzodiazepine-related drugs mixed into opioid supplies; lab drug-checking programs have repeatedly detected desalkylflurazepam/nordiazepam in ‘fentanyl’ samples—naloxone will not reverse benzodiazepine sedation, so prolonged monitoring is required after opioid reversal. Onset can be slow (often 45–120 minutes) relative to some benzos; redosing before the first dose peaks is a common route to blackout and over-sedation. Because pellets/powders can be mislabelled or dose-uneven, use a milligram scale and consider volumetric dosing for accurate measurement. Do not inject non-pharmaceutical benzos; insoluble excipients and poor solubility can cause severe tissue/vascular injury. Avoid driving and safety-sensitive tasks for at least the day of dosing and longer if sedation persists; long half-life increases risk of next‑day psychomotor impairment. Dependence and withdrawal can develop; never stop high‑frequency or high‑dose benzodiazepine use abruptly—use a gradual, supervised taper protocol. Use caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding: desalkylflurazepam has long half-life and can accumulate in infants via breast milk when mothers take prodrugs like quazepam/ethyl loflazepate; alternative agents or medical oversight are advised. People with sleep apnea, chronic lung disease, or the elderly are at higher risk of adverse outcomes from benzos and should avoid or minimize exposure. Flumazenil is not a take‑home safety measure: in dependent users or mixed overdoses it can trigger seizures; medical care should prioritize airway support and observation.",

    "notes": "Fosazepam is described as a diazepam-derived benzodiazepine; specific peer‑reviewed pharmacokinetic data are sparse, so potency and duration should be considered uncertain—start low and avoid stacking doses. Some community sources discuss fosazepam as a water‑soluble prodrug that is converted in vivo to long‑acting metabolites (e.g., nordazepam), which could prolong impairment into the next day; treat this as plausible but not confirmed by primary literature. Combining benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants—especially opioids, alcohol, barbiturates, or GHB/GBL—markedly increases risk of respiratory depression, aspiration, and fatal overdose. Even in the absence of other depressants, benzodiazepines can cause anterograde amnesia, motor incoordination, and disinhibition; avoid driving and high‑risk tasks until fully recovered. Blackouts and risky behaviors are more likely at higher doses or with redosing; set dose limits in advance and have a trusted sober person hold the supply if impulse control is an issue. Tolerance develops with repeated use over days to weeks; spacing sessions by multiple weeks materially reduces cumulative risk. If daily use occurs, do not abruptly stop—taper gradually under medical supervision to avoid seizures and other severe withdrawal phenomena. Never inject tablets or powders: fillers and insoluble particles can cause serious tissue damage and emboli; water solubility does not make pill solutions safe for IV use. If you must prepare solutions for accurate dosing, use clean volumetric techniques, label concentrations, and store securely to prevent accidental ingestion. People with respiratory disease, sleep apnea, or concurrent opioid therapy face elevated risks from any benzodiazepine; extra caution and avoidance of combinations are prudent. Grapefruit juice and other CYP inhibitors can raise levels of some benzodiazepines; fosazepam’s exact metabolic route is unclear, so avoid strong inhibitors/inducers unless advised by a clinician. Use drug‑interaction charts and equivalence calculators only as rough guides; interindividual response varies widely.",

    "notes": "Gidazepam is widely reported to act as a prodrug for the active metabolite desalkylgidazepam (bromonordiazepam), which contributes most of the anxiolytic effect; this conversion delays onset and encourages risky redosing if users expect a rapid benzodiazepine onset. Because desalkylgidazepam and related long-acting metabolites can have very long half-lives, effects may accumulate over days, raising next-day psychomotor impairment and sedation risks—especially with repeated dosing. RC-market products labeled 'gidazepam' or very low-dose '3 mg gidazepam' pellets are often actually desalkylgidazepam/bromonordiazepam; mislabeling is common, so laboratory drug checking is strongly advised before use. Avoid combining with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB, Z-drugs) due to synergistic respiratory depression and markedly increased overdose risk; co-use is implicated in many benzo-related harms. Tolerance to sedative/anxiolytic effects develops with frequent use and can drive escalating doses; abrupt cessation after sustained use can precipitate benzodiazepine withdrawal, including seizures—medical supervision is recommended for any taper. Older adults are more susceptible to falls, cognitive impairment, and next-day drowsiness; long-acting agents like desalkylgidazepam particularly increase these risks. If using a preparation of uncertain identity, start with the lowest possible dose, wait at least 3–4 hours before considering any redose, and avoid stacking doses across days to limit accumulation. Because many immunoassay urine screens detect benzodiazepine class metabolites (e.g., nordazepam-like structures), desalkylgidazepam exposure may yield a positive benzo result on drug tests. Therapeutic tablets reported in ex-US markets are commonly 20 mg and 50 mg for the parent drug; by contrast, RC-market desalkylgidazepam/bromonordiazepam often appears in 2.5–3 mg pellets—these forms have different potency and time course and should not be assumed equivalent. Some users exploit bromonordiazepam’s long half-life for tapers from short-acting benzos; while pharmacologically plausible, self-directed tapers carry risk and should ideally be clinician-guided.",

    "notes": "Halazepam is an oral benzodiazepine that is converted hepatically to the long-acting active metabolite desmethyldiazepam (a.k.a. nordazepam), which has a very long and variable elimination half-life; this can cause next-day psychomotor impairment and cumulative sedation over repeated doses. To reduce stacking and accidental overdose, avoid same-day redosing and be especially cautious on consecutive days of use. Combining halazepam with other central nervous system depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, Z-drugs, barbiturates) markedly increases the risk of profound sedation, respiratory depression, aspiration, and death; such combinations should be avoided. Older adults and people with liver impairment are at higher risk for prolonged sedation, confusion, and falls; smaller test doses and longer spacing between doses reduce risk. Do not abruptly stop after days to weeks of daily or near-daily use; benzodiazepine withdrawal can include anxiety rebound, insomnia, tremor, and in severe cases seizures; gradual tapering is safer than sudden cessation. Driving and operating machinery should be avoided at least until the following day and longer if residual effects persist, as long-acting metabolites can impair reaction time and memory. In pregnancy and lactation, benzodiazepines and their long-acting metabolites can accumulate in the neonate and breastfed infant; if exposure occurs, monitor infants for sedation, poor feeding, and hypotonia. Snorting or injecting crushed tablets or powders provides no established benefit, increases harm, and may introduce insoluble binders; oral administration is the least risky ROA for pharmaceutical benzodiazepines. Use of CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (or poor-metabolizer genotypes) can increase desmethyldiazepam exposure by analogy with diazepam and clorazepate; consider this when other medications or grapefruit-like foods are involved.",

    "notes": "This compound is a potent benzodiazepine; many users report significant effects at sub‑milligram doses, making volumetric dosing in ethanol or propylene glycol the safest practical method to avoid mismeasurement. TripSit’s benzo harm-reduction guidance specifically recommends liquid measurement for RC benzos active under 10 mg. It has a 3‑hydroxy group; by analogy to lorazepam/temazepam/oxazepam, most 3‑hydroxy benzodiazepines are cleared mainly by glucuronidation rather than CYP oxidation, so major CYP interactions may be fewer—this is a structural inference and not yet well-characterized for this exact drug. Strong additive CNS depression occurs with alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, tramadol, gabapentinoids, Z‑drugs, and sedating antihistamines; such combinations drive blackout, aspiration, and respiratory depression risks. Combining benzodiazepines with ketamine and other dissociatives increases ataxia and loss‑of‑consciousness risk; if someone becomes unresponsive, place them in the recovery position and seek help. Next‑day psychomotor and cognitive impairment can persist despite feeling ‘sober’; avoid driving or hazardous tasks until at least the following day. Amnesia and ‘delusions of sobriety’ are common across benzos and are frequently reported with 3‑hydroxyphenazepam; pre‑plan doses, avoid redosing for at least 2 hours after onset, and have a sober sitter to limit harm. Tolerance builds quickly with repeated use, and benzodiazepine withdrawal can be severe or life‑threatening; do not escalate doses to chase effects, and never stop chronic use abruptly—medical supervision is recommended for cessation. Novel/RC benzodiazepines are often found in counterfeit tablets with unpredictable potency; use only lab‑checked products where possible and treat any pressed ‘benzo’ of unknown origin as potentially over‑ or under‑dosed. User reports note easy dissolution in propylene glycol for accurate volumetric dosing. While insufflation has been reported anecdotally, non‑oral routes can increase unpredictability and harm; oral solutions offer more controllable kinetics.",

    "notes": "25T-2-NBOMe is a highly potent NBOMe analogue active in the microgram range; overdoses and medical emergencies across the NBOMe family have often resulted from dose misjudgment and mislabeling. Testing and precise measurement are critical. NBOMes have been widely mis-sold as LSD on blotter; LSD fluoresces strongly under 360 nm UV and reacts purple with Ehrlich/Hofmann for lysergamides, while NBOMes have distinct reagent reactions and do not fluoresce like LSD—use multiple reagents (Ehrlich/Hofmann for lysergamides; Marquis/Froehde to screen phenethylamines) and avoid assuming blotters are LSD. Volumetric dosing is strongly advised: dissolve a known weighed amount into a measured volume to create a µg-per-mL solution—drop sizes vary; use measured syringes or pipettes and label clearly; avoid handling loose powder. Sublingual/buccal routes are typical; many NBOMe salts show poor and variable oral GI bioavailability—do not rely on swallowing as a safety test. Insufflation is strongly discouraged due to rapid spikes, severe mucosal irritation, and a disproportionate number of adverse events. Acute risks include vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation, and seizures at high dose; emergencies have included rhabdomyolysis. Manage set/setting, avoid hot environments, sip electrolytes, and do not redose the same day. Benzodiazepines are commonly used in clinical settings for severe agitation or seizures from psychedelic crises; avoid antipsychotics unless medically indicated. Combining NBOMes with lithium has been associated with life‑threatening seizures in classic psychedelic reports; avoid this combination entirely. Tramadol and DXM raise serotonin syndrome and seizure risks and should not be combined; bupropion can further lower the seizure threshold. People with cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, or severe mental illness should avoid. Bitter and mouth‑numbing taste on blotter is often reported with NBOMes, but taste alone is unreliable—testing is the only safe approach. Anecdotal reports suggest NBOMes may be associated with HPPD-like persisting visuals; pace use with multi‑week breaks.",

    "notes": "Reason for strong avoidance: para-Chloroamphetamine (4-CA, PCA) is a well-characterized, long-lasting serotonergic neurotoxin in animals; 4-CMA is the N-methyl analogue and likely undergoes N-dealkylation to 4-CA, so even single exposures may produce enduring serotonergic injury. Protective effects of SERT blockers and peripheral 5-HT depletion against PCA neurotoxicity indicate a serotonin-dependent toxic process, not merely acute depletion. In rats, PCA causes degeneration of serotonergic axons with persistent reductions in 5-HT, 5-HIAA, SERT, and tryptophan hydroxylase; some damage becomes irreversible 24–48 h post-dose. Therefore, redosing 4-CMA within a session or on consecutive days plausibly increases the chance that reversible depletion progresses toward axonal injury. In hot or high-exertion settings, serotonergic stimulants raise risk of hyperthermia; conversely, excessive water intake can cause hyponatremia. Safer-clubbing guidance recommends sipping about 250 mL/h at rest and up to ~500 mL/h when dancing, using electrolyte-containing fluids; avoid both dehydration and overhydration. Serotonin syndrome can occur when combining serotonergic agents (e.g., MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, MDMA, DXM, tramadol); seek urgent care for agitation, clonus, tremor, hyperthermia, confusion. Community early warnings have documented vendors listing 4-CMA and calls to test suspect products; pills/crystals sold as other stimulants can contain unexpected chlorinated compounds—only laboratory drug checking definitively identifies 4-CMA. Multi-reagent kits (e.g., Marquis, Froehde, Simon’s, Zimmerman, Morris) help screen but are not definitive; treat unknowns as hazardous until lab-verified. Because of the high neurotoxicity signal from PCA and the plausible metabolic link, conservative harm reduction is to avoid use; if exposed, use the minimum possible dose, do not redose, and leave at least several weeks before any further serotonergic exposure. Those with cardiovascular disease, seizure disorders, or psychiatric vulnerability (anxiety, depression) may be at heightened risk of adverse outcomes. Women appear disproportionately represented in MDMA-related hyponatremia cases; similar caution applies to serotonergic stimulants. Maintain cool ambient temperature, take rest breaks, monitor for jaw tension, agitation, and overheating, and avoid polydrug use.",

Abrupt cessation after sustained use can precipitate severe withdrawal (anxiety, insomnia, tremor) and, at high dependence levels, seizures; gradual, individualized tapering is strongly advised under medical supervision. Concomitant use with opioids or alcohol markedly increases the risk of respiratory depression and fatal overdose; if opioids are involved in a setting, having naloxone available can reverse opioid toxicity but will not reverse benzodiazepine effects. Genetic and drug–drug variability in CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 metabolism (the same pathways relevant for diazepam) can prolong effects or increase sedation in poor metabolizers or when strong inhibitors are co‑administered. Avoid driving or operating machinery the day after moderate–high doses or repeated dosing due to prolonged psychomotor and memory impairment. During pregnancy and breastfeeding, benzodiazepine exposure (including via diazepam/nordazepam from medazepam) can cause neonatal sedation and feeding difficulties; alternative strategies or close monitoring are recommended if use occurs. In unregulated markets, counterfeit benzodiazepine tablets and opioid supplies contaminated with benzodiazepines (‘benzo‑dope’) are common; use trusted sources or drug checking where available, start with test doses, and never mix with other depressants.",

    "notes": "Oral phenylephrine has poor and variable systemic availability (~38%) and modern evidence reviews conclude that monograph doses (10 mg) are no better than placebo for nasal decongestion; even higher immediate‑release doses up to 40 mg often fail to show benefit, so escalating the dose to ‘make it work’ mainly raises cardiovascular risk without improving congestion. Intranasal phenylephrine offers short‑term relief but continuous daily use beyond a few days can induce rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound congestion) with tolerance and worse blockage; reports describe onset as early as about 3 days and resolution after withdrawal within days to weeks. Intravenous phenylephrine should be used only in monitored medical settings; standard doses are in micrograms, not milligrams—mis-dosing can precipitate severe hypertension, reflex bradycardia, decreased cardiac output, and ischemic complications. Extravasation of IV phenylephrine can cause local tissue injury/necrosis; careful line selection and monitoring are required. Systemic exposure (especially IV) can trigger reflex vagal bradycardia; patients with compromised cardiac function may experience reduced cardiac output from increased afterload. Breastfeeding: oral/IV phenylephrine may reduce milk production; intranasal/ophthalmic exposure is less likely to impair lactation; prefer alternatives in newborn/preterm infants. Oral phenylephrine’s limited efficacy means non-drug options (saline rinses, humidification) or evidence‑based alternatives may be preferable; avoid combining with other sympathomimetics to ‘stack’ effects due to additive pressor risk. If using nasal formulations, adhere to the lowest effective concentration for the shortest time (generally a few days) to avoid rebound; consider steroid nasal sprays for persistent rhinitis under medical guidance.

    "notes": "• Active oral range is reported as 20–35 mg with 18–30 h duration in the original PiHKAL entry; this unusually long span increases risks of fatigue, sleep loss, and decision-making lapses late in the experience, so plan a 36–48 h recovery window and avoid redosing. • Onset can be slow; some G-series compounds reach full intensity 2–3 h after dosing. Redosing before 3 h risks accidental over-intoxication. • Users and Shulgin’s own notes describe relatively mild visual phenomena and a clearer, more stimulating headspace compared to other 2C-x, with occasional appetite suppression; stimulation without strong visuals can still produce anxiety, tachycardia, and vasoconstriction. • Because the active range is low tens of milligrams, accurate weighing is essential; use a calibrated 0.001 g scale or volumetric dosing to prevent dangerous overshoot. • Avoid insufflation: other 2C-x phenethylamines cause severe nasal irritation and unpredictable potency when snorted; oral is the established route for 2C-G. • Do not combine with MAOIs (including harmala alkaloids); MAO inhibition can markedly and unpredictably potentiate psychedelics. • Combining with other stimulants (including high caffeine doses) increases cardiovascular strain and anxiety; keep caffeine typical dietary or lower, and avoid amphetamines. • If an experience becomes overwhelming, non-pharmacological de-escalation (reassurance, quiet space, hydration) is first-line; in a true crisis, benzodiazepines can be used by a sober sitter or medical professional, but repeated benzo use carries tolerance and dependence risks and should not be routine. • 2C-G has been scarce; recent market appearances have included inconsistent labeling and premixed capsules that prevent accurate dose control. Use a lab-based drug checking service when possible; reagent results for 2C-G are not well characterized. • People with cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, severe anxiety, or sleep disorders should avoid 2C-G due to its long stimulation window and potential for insomnia. • Legal status varies; synthesis, possession, or distribution may be illegal in many jurisdictions.",

    "notes": "• Identification and purity: 3‑F‑PCP first appeared in Europe (Slovenia) in late 2020; multiple user communities have since noted batch variability and occasional mislabeling as other PCP analogues (e.g., 3‑Cl‑PCP), making lab‑based drug checking highly advisable. Reagent tests are non‑specific for the class; GC/MS or FTIR is preferable via local drug‑checking services.\n• Onset and redosing: Several reports emphasize a slow or uneven come‑up—especially orally/sublingually—so avoid topping up for at least 2–3 hours to prevent accidental overdosing into manic confusion.\n• Nasal harm reduction: Insufflation commonly causes severe burn and caustic drip; use finely powdered, tiny test lines, allow long gaps between bumps, and rinse with sterile saline after sessions to reduce tissue damage and epistaxis risk.\n• Functional impairment and injury risk: PCP‑class dissociatives can produce profound analgesia, proprioceptive distortion, and overconfidence. Do not cook, drive, swim, or climb during the session and for the entire residual period. Use a sober sitter for strong doses.\n• Mental health cautions: High or repeated doses increase risk of acute psychosis‑like states (paranoia, delusions, disinhibition). Individuals with psychosis‑spectrum or bipolar histories should avoid.\n• Tolerance/compulsion: Rapid tolerance accrues within a session and over days. Spacing sessions by 10–14 days reduces escalation.\n• Hydration and temperature: Maintain gentle hydration and a cool environment; avoid strenuous activity—stimulant‑like activation plus dissociation is associated with overheating and accidents in PCP‑class use.\n• IM use is high‑risk: Variable solubility, unknown excipients, and pH can cause tissue injury or abscess; many find IM doses deceptively strong and dysphoric beyond low–moderate ranges. Prefer non‑injecting routes.",

    "notes": "DOC is a potent psychedelic amphetamine with a slow onset and very long duration; because onset may take 2–3 hours, redosing early greatly increases the risk of accidental overdose and an excessively long experience. Verified drug-checking programs have repeatedly found DOC sold as LSD on blotter; when ingesting unknown blotter, wait at least 3 hours before redosing, ideally after reagent/lab testing, to avoid stacking doses of a long-acting compound. DOC can cause peripheral vasoconstriction and stimulant-like effects (elevated heart rate/blood pressure, chest tightness) especially at higher doses; those with cardiovascular disease or hypertension should avoid it and all users should avoid combining with other vasoconstrictors (stimulants, decongestants, high-dose caffeine). Lithium has been repeatedly associated with seizures and severe adverse reactions when combined with classic psychedelics; treat this combination as dangerous and avoid it. Mixing with MAOIs is also considered dangerous due to unpredictable potentiation and hypertensive risk; tramadol adds seizure risk and serotonergic toxicity potential. If acute anxiety or dysphoria occur, non-pharmacological de-escalation (calm environment, breathing, reassurance) is first-line; benzodiazepines can attenuate the experience but should not be combined with alcohol or other depressants due to additive sedation and respiratory depression. Because activity is in the low-milligram range, use a calibrated milligram scale or volumetric dosing; never eyeball powder. DOC commonly disrupts sleep; plan for next-day impairment and avoid driving or operating machinery during and after effects. Tolerance builds rapidly after one dose and substantially reduces effects for about 1–2 weeks; cross-tolerance exists with other serotonergic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, DOB/DOM). Human pharmacokinetic data (including elimination half-life) are not established; reported half-life figures online are estimates inferred from long duration rather than measured studies, so dose-spacing and conservative titration are essential. Drug checking (reagent and, where available, lab confirmation) is strongly recommended for any blotter or liquid purported to be LSD given frequent mislabeling with DOx compounds in some markets.",

    "notes": "Potency and margin: PiHKAL and Erowid note active oral range roughly 20–40 mg with some users sensitive at ~10–20 mg; Shulgin cautioned the psychoactive-to-adverse dose margin may be relatively narrow, so conservative titration is prudent. Effects duration is long (often 8–12 h) with residual stimulation or difficulty sleeping for some users, so plan set/setting and sleep accordingly. Qualitative reports mention GI upset, tremor, peripheral tingling/numbness, and occasional light-headedness; at 40 mg some noted intestinal cramps/diarrhea and sleep difficulty later in the day—avoid strenuous activity early in the come-up and stay hydrated. Animal data cited by Erowid describe bradycardia and hypothermia at high doses, so people with cardiovascular or thermoregulation vulnerabilities should be extra cautious. Cross-tolerance is expected with other 5‑HT2A psychedelics (e.g., LSD, mescaline), reducing effect intensity if taken again within days; spacing experiences by at least one to two weeks minimizes tolerance and psychological strain. Combining with MAOIs can unpredictably intensify and prolong effects and has a poor safety margin; lithium with serotonergic psychedelics has credible reports of seizures and severe adverse reactions—do not combine. Because TMA-2 is rare in current markets and has occasionally been confused with other phenethylamines, use multi-reagent testing; Project Response color testing has reported green→brown shifts—use Marquis/Mandelin/Mecke and a lab if possible. Use an accurate scale; for fine measurement or sub-milligram precision, use volumetric dosing to avoid weighing error. Legal controls vary; EU Council (2003) urged Member States to control TMA‑2, and many countries have scheduled it or control it as a TMA isomer—check local law before possession, ordering, or travel.",

    "notes": "Rationale and harm-reduction augmentations (with sources):\n- Dosing range and slow onset: Erowid’s TMA-series summary lists TMA at 100–250 mg with 6–8 h duration; the come-up can exceed an hour. This supports keeping initial doses lower than historical “common” levels and avoiding early redoses. Slow onsets are a frequent cause of accidental overconsumption.\n- Cardiovascular load: As an amphetamine, TMA can increase heart rate and blood pressure; combining with other stimulants substantially raises risks of hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute cardiac/neurological events. Dose in a cool environment, avoid vigorous activity/saunas, and hydrate normally (not excessively).\n- MAOI combinations: Harmala MAOIs and pharmaceutical MAOIs can markedly potentiate and prolong phenethylamine psychedelics; mescaline + harmala reports describe large intensity/duration increases. Treat TMA + MAOI as dangerous.\n- Insomnia planning: Residual stimulation can persist after the psychological peak; dose early in the day and plan for sleep hygiene post-experience.\n- Tolerance and spacing: Phenethylamine psychedelics such as mescaline show rapid tolerance and cross-tolerance to other classical psychedelics; spacing by at least 7–14 days reduces blunted responses and compulsive redosing.\n- Identity risk and drug checking: TMA is rare and has historically been confused with other amphetamine psychedelics; verify identity with lab-based drug checking wherever available. At minimum, use multi-reagent testing with skepticism; a Reddit report documents a TMA sample verified by Saferparty, underscoring the value of lab confirmation.\n- Accurate measurement: Because active doses are in the 100–250 mg range and batches vary, weigh doses with a reliable milligram scale; premeasure, avoid rushing, and consider an allergy test.\n- Legal risk: In the U.S., TMA is a Schedule I substance under the CSA; legal penalties can be severe. Verify your local laws.\n- Medical exclusions: Those with cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmias, or significant anxiety disorders should avoid TMA due to amphetamine-like physiological stress and potential for panic. Seek medical advice if unsure. ",

Use reagent kits as a first pass and, where available, submit to a lab drug‑checking service; do not escalate doses until identity is confirmed. Large single doses (hundreds of milligrams) raise cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, blood pressure) typical of phenethylamines; avoid stimulants, overheated venues, and dehydration. Onset can be delayed and subtle; redosing too early is a common cause of accidental over‑intoxication—wait at least 3–4 hours before considering any increase. Avoid lithium entirely: combinations with serotonergic psychedelics have precipitated seizures and severe reactions. Avoid tramadol/bupropion and MAOIs due to seizure and serotonergic risks. Tolerance to serotonergic psychedelics develops rapidly and decays over ~1–2 weeks; stacking trips compresses sleep, raises anxiety, and blunts subsequent responses. Because clinical pharmacokinetics are unknown, those with cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, or significant psychiatric comorbidity should abstain; if someone becomes overheated or confused, prioritize cooling, hydration with electrolytes, a calm environment, and seek medical help for chest pain, severe agitation, or seizures.",

Animal and in vitro work suggest G-protein-biased μOR agonism, but in vivo still produces respiratory depression at higher doses; therefore the classic opioid risks remain, particularly with polydrug use. Batch-to-batch potency appears highly variable by user reports; some describe active effects at 5–15 mg sublingual while others report limited effects below 50–100 mg orally. A recurring community hazard is a delayed or wave-like come-up (peaks 4–8+ hours post-dose), which makes early redosing especially risky due to stacking and late-onset oversedation. Naloxone should be carried and administered for suspected opioid overdose; multiple doses may be required, and sedation from non-opioid adulterants (e.g., xylazine) will not be reversed — always call emergency services. Avoid combining with other depressants (benzos, alcohol, GHB/GBL, other opioids, gabapentinoids); these combinations markedly increase the risk of respiratory compromise. Because supply chains for new opioid RCs have been targeted by scammers and adulteration is common in unregulated markets, avoid sharing personal/financial information, be skeptical of unsolicited vendors, and prefer accredited drug checking where available. For measuring, use a 0.001 g scale; consider volumetric dosing and perform a 1–2 mg allergy test, then wait a full day before any additional dosing to detect delayed effects. Do not inject; solvent, excipient, and sterility unknowns greatly increase harm. People attempting to self-manage withdrawal should recognize dependence and tolerance can still occur with biased agonists; medical supervision is strongly recommended.",

Advanced laboratory methods (e.g., GC/MS or LC–HRMS) are required to reliably distinguish 3-FEA from related isomers like 3-FA or 4-FA; reagent kits cannot confirm identity and mislabeling has been documented in the stimulant market. Oral administration is generally preferred over insufflation for fluoroamphetamines due to significant nasal irritation and mucosal injury risk. Combining with other stimulants or high caffeine markedly increases cardiovascular strain; stick to one stimulant at a time and avoid energy drinks. As an entactogenic stimulant, 3-FEA carries typical risks of hyperthermia and dehydration; sip fluids regularly but avoid overhydration to reduce hyponatremia risk, and take cooling breaks in hot environments. Redosing beyond the initial peak increases adverse effects (nausea, tremor, jaw tension, insomnia) while providing diminishing returns; allow full offset and adequate sleep before considering any reuse. Do not self-treat stimulant comedowns with beta-blockers; if you experience chest pain, severe headache, confusion, or very high blood pressure/heart rate, seek urgent care—benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment in emergency settings for stimulant toxicity. Evidence on human pharmacokinetics is limited; metabolism pathways are not established, so be especially cautious if taking CYP2D6-inhibiting medications (inference from MDMA data).",

    "notes": "Identity and pharmacokinetics are poorly characterized in humans; treat all doses as experimental and err on the side of extreme caution. Microgram-level potency reported by users means a small weighing error can be catastrophic; always use volumetric dosing with a clearly labeled, low-concentration solution, and perform an allergy test before any psychoactive dose. Fentanyl-class overdoses often require multiple naloxone administrations or a continuous infusion; have multiple naloxone units available and expect possible re-narcosis after initial reversal because naloxone is shorter-acting than many potent opioids. Inhalation/smoking is widely reported as inefficient and inconsistent; heat may degrade the drug and make dose control unreliable, increasing the risk of accidental redosing. If insufflating, rinse with sterile or isotonic saline before and after and rotate nostrils to reduce mucosal injury and infection risk. Injection has the highest lethality risk: if someone chooses to inject against advice, use new sterile equipment, sterile water, and a 0.22–0.30 µm wheel filter; avoid heating unknown powders, and never inject alone. Use-with-someone and staggered test dosing (waiting at least one full onset-to-peak window) reduce the chance of stacking doses during a delayed onset. Avoid combining with any CNS depressant (alcohol, benzos, z‑drugs, barbiturates, gabapentinoids), which greatly increases respiratory depression risk; people with sleep apnea, COPD, or low baseline respiratory reserve face heightened danger. Consider lab-based drug checking (FTIR/GC‑MS) where available to confirm identity and detect adulterants; mail-in or site-based services exist in multiple regions. Label and child-proof any prepared solution; store in light-protected containers at cool temperature to reduce degradation and accidental exposure. Because human metabolism is unknown, avoid CYP3A4/2D6 inhibitors or inducers when possible, and avoid QT‑prolongers as a precaution (some opioids—e.g., methadone—affect hERG). Dependency and tolerance can escalate rapidly; spacing use and planning for a naloxone-equipped, sober sitter are protective steps. Smoking and chasing on foil have been reported to waste material and give short, deceptive effects, leading some users to mistakenly escalate dose; do not assume lack of immediate effect means it is ‘weak.’",

    "notes": "Lofentanil is among the most potent opioids known; DrugBank describes it as slightly more potent than carfentanil, underscoring that microgram‑scale mismeasurement can be fatal. Volumetric dilution and analytical verification are essential if this substance is encountered; ordinary milligram scales are wholly inadequate. Opioid and other CNS depressant combinations (especially benzodiazepines and alcohol) markedly increase the risk of respiratory arrest. Fentanyl‑class agents can cause sudden chest wall/diaphragmatic rigidity (“wooden chest syndrome,” WCS), often within 1–3 minutes after rapid IV administration; bag‑mask ventilation may be ineffective until naloxone and/or neuromuscular blockade with advanced airway management are provided by clinicians. Because naloxone is shorter‑acting than many fentanyl analogs, re‑sedation (renarcotization) can occur; observation and repeated dosing or infusion may be necessary. Routine drug‑checking FTIR has a ~5% limit of detection and can miss trace high‑potency opioids; pairing with fentanyl test strips improves detection of fentanyl and some analogs but cannot identify which analog or quantify potency. Lofentanil shows meaningful κ‑opioid receptor activity in vitro, which may contribute to dysphoria and sedation at analgesic doses, narrowing the safety margin. Human pharmacokinetics for lofentanil are not established; avoid redosing based on subjective effects, and assume a prolonged and variable duration. Small but statistically significant QTc changes have been observed with fentanyl in clinical settings; while torsades is uncommon with fentanyl-class agents (in contrast to methadone), caution is warranted in patients with long‑QT risks or on QT‑prolonging drugs. Buprenorphine can precipitate acute withdrawal in people physically dependent on full μ‑agonists; initiation should be medically supervised. Even trace contamination with lofentanil can render a non‑opioid sample lethally potent; a negative fentanyl strip does not guarantee absence of other ultra‑potent analogs, and a positive result does not quantify dose.",

Several high-dose accounts note worrisome cardiovascular strain (e.g., perceived hypertension, shortness of breath) and difficult comedowns—strongly avoid megadoses and stacking. Like other arylcyclohexylamines, accident risk, amnesia, and psychotic-like reactions increase with dose; people with psychosis-spectrum vulnerability should avoid. Intranasal use can damage nasal mucosa; safer sniffing includes finely crushing, using personal clean equipment, and rinsing with water/saline before and after. Reagent/FTIR checking is recommended to verify identity, but note FTIR’s ~5% limit of detection; coupling with relevant test strips improves detection of trace adulterants (e.g., benzos/fentanyls in mixed markets). Dissociatives with depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, benzos) substantially increase risk of respiratory depression, blackouts, and aspiration; avoid these combinations outside medical care. Repeated/frequent use of dissociatives has been linked to urinary tract/bladder issues (best documented for ketamine); although specific data for MDPCP are lacking, caution is warranted: hydrate modestly, monitor for urinary symptoms, and reduce/stop if they appear.

The slow onset (often ≥60 minutes) and very long tail create a strong temptation to redose too early; given that even 30 mg remained steady for 12 hours, redosing within the first half‑day could compound into an unexpectedly intense and prolonged experience. PIHKAL notes pronounced synergy when ALEPH‑6 was used as a 'primer' for LSD and followed later by cannabis, consistent with broader guidance that cannabis and classical psychedelics can produce unpredictable potentiation—plan set/setting accordingly and avoid polydrug use on first trials. Within the sulfur‑containing phenethylamine family, severe adverse outcomes have been documented for 2C‑T‑7 (including deaths, especially with insufflation and with MDMA co‑use); while ALEPH‑6 is a different compound, this history argues for extra caution with thio‑substituted phenethylamines. Combining classical psychedelics with lithium has been associated with seizures and extreme reactions; those prescribed lithium should avoid experimentation entirely. Because this compound is rare, mislabeling or adulteration is a major risk; use reagent testing (multi‑reagent) and, where possible, send a small sample to a lab‑based drug checking service before any bioassay. Given the lack of pharmacokinetic data, those with cardiovascular disease, seizure disorders, or a personal/family history of psychotic or bipolar spectrum illness should abstain; if anyone proceeds despite risks, they should use meticulous volumetric dosing, a milligram scale, a trusted sober sitter, and have a plan to manage an acute crisis (e.g., access to medical care; some communities use prescribed benzodiazepines under medical advice to terminate overwhelming trips).",

The ALEPH family (e.g., ALEPH-2) shows erratic dose–response between individuals, so precise measurement and allergy testing (≤1 mg) are prudent. Slow onset (often >60 min) means redosing early can inadvertently create an overlong, overintense experience; wait at least 3–4 h before any change in dose. Driving and hazard work should be avoided for the entire active period and until baseline the next day—Shulgin notes basic tasks became ‘impossible’ at 10 mg. As a substituted amphetamine, sympathetic effects (tachycardia, mild hypertension, mydriasis, jaw tension) can occur; people with cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or a seizure disorder should avoid. Avoid non-oral routes; some sulfur-containing phenethylamines (e.g., 2C‑T‑7) have produced severe events and deaths when insufflated—while not the same drug, this signals risk for this structural family and argues strongly against nasal/IM/IV use. Combining with MAOIs is dangerous (unpredictable potentiation of monoamine effects); tramadol raises seizure and serotonin-syndrome risk; lithium and tricyclics have produced dangerous reactions with classical psychedelics—avoid. Because the substance is rare and markets are unregulated, adulteration/mislabeling is a significant risk: use professional drug checking (FTIR/GC-MS) where available; reagent kits are only preliminary screens. Set, setting, sleep, and nutrition matter: plan 12–24 h with no obligations, maintain light electrolytes, sip water regularly but avoid overhydration, and have a trusted sober sitter for first trials. Tolerance builds acutely and partially cross-tolerates with other psychedelics; allow at least 7–14 days between sessions to regain sensitivity.

    "notes": "Identity and mislabeling: ALEPH‑2 is extremely rare in circulation. Confirm identity with multi‑reagent testing and, ideally, laboratory drug checking (FTIR/GC‑MS) before ingesting; mis-sold DOx/NBOMe/2C‑x has been documented in the wild. Shulgin lists oral activity at approximately 4–8 mg with 8–16 h duration; due to steep, idiosyncratic dose–response, first assays should be conservative (≤2–3 mg) and no redosing for at least 3 h to avoid stacked overduration and overstimulation. Thio‑substituted phenethylamines (e.g., 2C‑T‑2/‑7) have a track record of unpredictable toxicity and wide interindividual sensitivity; avoid insufflation or parenteral routes because of local irritation and greater unpredictability. Cardiovascular load (tachycardia, vasoconstriction, BP elevation) and mydriasis/bruxism are common; those with cardiovascular, seizure, or significant psychiatric histories should avoid or use only with medical clearance. Potential weak reversible MAO‑A inhibition has been reported in vitro for para‑alkylthio amphetamines; combinations with MAOIs or potent serotonergics (e.g., MDMA, high‑dose tryptamines) increase the risk of hypertensive or serotonergic crises. Onset can be slow and deceptive; early redoses frequently overextend duration and intensity. Plan set/setting and recovery (quiet environment, light nutrition, electrolytes, and sleep hygiene) and anticipate insomnia late in the course; do not use alcohol to force sleep. If severe agitation, hyperthermia, chest pain, or continuous vomiting occur, seek urgent medical care and avoid taking additional substances to self‑treat. Because US mail‑in lab testing via DrugsData is on administrative pause (as of April 2025), consider local in‑person services listed via drugchecking community resources.",

    "notes": "4-CMC is frequently mis-sold or found as an adulterant in MDMA or 3‑MMC samples; unexpected exposure and dose stacking are credible risks—drug checking is strongly advised and, if not possible, test a very small amount first and wait at least 2 hours before considering more. Multiple European drug checking alerts (2023–2025) document 4‑CMC sold as MDMA or 3‑MMC and pills containing both MDMA and 4‑CMC, with unknown interaction potential. Reports from Swiss services repeatedly note user complaints of severe headaches and kidney/liver pain post‑use, and a strong urge to redose. Formal human pharmacokinetics are not established; assuming MDMA‑like timing is unsafe—avoid rapid redosing to limit cumulative cardiovascular and serotonergic burden. Compared to oral use, insufflation produces a faster, shorter, and harsher profile with a caustic drip and increased nasal irritation; prefer oral if choosing to use, and avoid shared snorting equipment to reduce infection risk. As a serotonergic/stimulant cathinone, 4‑CMC should not be combined with MAOIs, DXM, tramadol, or other strong stimulants; SSRIs/SNRIs can both blunt effects and contribute to serotonin toxicity at higher doses. Overheating and dehydration are realistic risks during prolonged activity; take breaks in cool areas and sip ~300 mL non‑alcoholic fluids per hour (do not overhydrate). Neurotoxicity is suspected (particularly for para‑halogenated analogues); because evidence in humans is scarce, spacing use widely (≥1–2 weeks), minimizing total dose, and avoiding binges are prudent. Strong compulsive redosing has been reported; pre‑measuring a single dose and setting a stop-time can help reduce escalation. Post‑acute effects may include low mood, anxiety, and sleep disruption up to 24 hours; seek medical care urgently for persistent chest pain, hyperthermia, confusion, severe headache, or signs of serotonin toxicity (agitation, tremor, clonus).",

    "notes": "AMT is a long-acting serotonergic tryptamine with stimulant and entactogenic features; nausea and vomiting are common, especially early in the experience. Onset is often slow (60–180 minutes), which leads some to redose prematurely; this is a frequent cause of overdosing—wait at least 2.5–3 hours before considering any change. AMT’s serotonergic action and reported mild MAOI activity mean combinations with other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, MAOIs, MDMA, tramadol, dextromethorphan, linezolid, St John’s Wort) significantly increase the risk of serotonin syndrome; avoid these mixes entirely. Distinguish AMT from 5-MeO-AMT: 5-MeO-AMT is active at single-digit milligram doses and has been linked to medical emergencies; confusing the two has led to overdoses—verify substance identity via trusted drug checking. Because AMT is sometimes sold as different salt forms (e.g., succinate) or freebase, be aware that equal milligram weights may not equal the same base amount; if the salt form is unknown, start at the very low end. Insufflation and smoking/freebasing produce faster, sharper onsets and are associated with more nausea, irritation, and anxiety; oral use is generally better tolerated. Plan for the very long duration and potential insomnia: avoid driving/operating machinery until the next day and keep the environment cool, with periodic fluids and electrolytes to mitigate hyperthermia risk if exerting. Use an accurate milligram scale and avoid eyeballing; if volumetric dosing is used, label clearly and measure precisely. Given variable potency and common misrepresentation in the unregulated market, use professional drug checking where available and avoid polydrug use.",

Because authentic AEM appears inactive at typical 'psychedelic' testing ranges, any material sold as 'AEM' that produces clear psychedelic or stimulant effects may be mislabelled or adulterated; drug checking is strongly advised where available. Unknown novel powders are frequently misdeclared in street and online markets, and harm‑reduction agencies repeatedly document samples containing unexpected actives; assume identity uncertainty until analytically verified. If a person insists on test‑dosing for identification, perform an allergy test first (≈1 mg), wait several hours, and use a calibrated milligram scale or volumetric dosing to avoid accidental overdosing; inaccurate measurement is a common cause of emergencies with research chemicals. Avoid non‑oral routes (insufflation, injection, rectal) for unknown phenethylamines due to faster kinetics, uncertain potency, and greater adverse event risk. Do not combine with MAOIs, tramadol, or additional stimulants in case the substance is an active phenethylamine; several psychedelic phenethylamine combinations are flagged as caution/unsafe by harm‑reduction guides. Absence of effect at 220 mg does not imply safety at higher doses; idiosyncratic reactions or contamination remain possible. Legal status varies; possession or synthesis may be illegal. There are no pharmacokinetic data or clinical safety data for AEM in humans.",

    "notes": "4C-D (Ariadne) is a rare α-ethyl phenethylamine described in PiHKAL with only threshold-level psychedelia at ~20–30 mg; detailed modern human data remain sparse. Identity confusion has occurred in community discussions (e.g., fears of DOM/DOx mislabel), so treating any unverified sample as potentially long-acting is prudent until lab-checked. Community reports since ~2018–2024 describe mild stimulation, warmth, sociability and low visuals, with many noting that higher single oral doses (≈40–150 mg) were needed for clear effects, implying a wide potency variance and/or material variability. Onset can be slow and subtle, increasing the temptation to redose; wait at least 3 hours before considering any change to reduce overdose/stacking risk. Insufflation has been reported as harsh on the nose/throat with little benefit compared to oral dosing; oral remains the most documented route. As a phenethylamine, transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure are plausible; those with cardiovascular, seizure or serious psychiatric histories should avoid or use extra caution. Strong serotonergic combinations (MAOIs, tramadol, DXM, methylene blue/linezolid, heavy SSRI/SNRI stacking) raise serotonin toxicity risk; lithium has a history of dangerous interactions with psychedelics and should be strictly avoided. Because it is obscure, authenticity and purity are the primary hazards—use professional drug checking where available; if unavailable, start with sub-milligram allergy tests, then single small doses using an accurate milligram scale (or volumetric dosing) and never redose quickly. There are no human pharmacokinetic studies; half-life is unknown, and total effect length should not be assumed to equal elimination half-life. Long-term neurotoxicity or cardiotoxicity data do not exist; prudent spacing between experiences (weeks) and conservative dosing are advisable.",

The come‑up is often delayed, with some users not reaching clear effects until 3–5 hours; redosing during the come‑up has led to accidental overdosing. Volumetric dosing is strongly advised for accurate sub‑10 mg measurement and to reduce weighing error risk. Compared to 2C‑E, 2C‑P is typically longer in duration and can be more intensely visual with a heavier body load at higher doses. Cardiovascular side‑effects (tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction) and anxiety are reported more often at higher doses or with stimulant combinations; those with cardiovascular disease should avoid. Insufflation has a faster onset but is frequently described as more uncomfortable and physically taxing than oral use. In unregulated markets, powders or pills sold as a '2C' or 'Tusi/pink cocaine' have repeatedly contained no 2C substance and instead mixtures of ketamine/MDMA/stimulants and even traces of fentanyls/benzodiazepines; reagent testing or using a professional drug‑checking service is therefore recommended and avoiding redose is prudent if onset is delayed.

    "notes": "3-MeO-PCE is a potent arylcyclohexylamine NMDA antagonist with stimulating dissociation; onset is faster and intranasal effects are steeper than oral, which raises the risk of overdoing early redoses. Multi-day or high-dose use has been repeatedly associated (anecdotally and in community reports) with hypomania/mania, paranoia, and psychosis; avoid consecutive-day use and keep doses spaced by at least several days. Combining with central nervous system depressants—especially alcohol, opioids, or GHB—markedly raises risks of dangerous sedation, impaired airway reflexes, and accidents; many emergency data show alcohol+benzo/opioid synergy and dissociatives independently impair coordination. Benzodiazepines are sometimes used medically to manage agitation in emergencies, but using them recreationally with dissociatives increases blackout, fall, and respiratory risks; avoid this mix. Stimulants (including prescription ADHD meds) can aggravate cardiovascular strain and manic thinking during dissociatives; if already on stimulants, avoid redosing/stacking. Chronic heavy dissociative use (best-characterized with ketamine) is linked to cystitis-like urinary and biliary complications; though specific 3-MeO-PCE data are limited, monitor for urinary urgency, pain, or hematuria and reduce/stop use if they appear. Strongly consider drug checking (FTIR/GC–MS) when available; dissociatives are frequently mis-sold or misidentified in the unregulated market, and mislabeled ketamine-class powders are documented. Because of high potency and batch variability, perform an allergy test (1–2 mg), use precise measurement, and consider volumetric dosing. For nasal use, grind finely, use small test lines, and rinse with isotonic saline before/after to reduce mucosal irritation. Do not drive or engage in hazardous tasks for at least the rest of the day after dosing; residual impairment may persist. People with a personal or family history of psychosis or bipolar spectrum conditions should be particularly cautious or avoid use.",

    "notes": "- Potency and identity are highly variable in 2024–2025 street markets. Drug‑checking services report many samples sold as “3/4‑MMC” actually contain other cathinones (NEP, a‑PVP, 2‑MMC), which can be several‑fold more potent or longer‑lasting. Multi‑reagent testing helps but may not distinguish specific cathinones; FT‑IR/GC‑MS is preferable.\n- Oral and intranasal onsets/durations match community datasets: oral 15–45 min onset with 2–5 h total; sniffed 5–15 min onset with 1–3 h total. These short, punchy effects promote redosing within 45–120 min, increasing acute risks.\n- Human PK shows a short elimination half‑life around 2.1–2.2 h, much shorter than MDMA (~7.9–8 h). The brief half‑life explains more compulsive dosing and higher cardiovascular/overheating load within a session.\n- Significant peripheral vasoconstriction has been documented after prolonged/repeated dosing (e.g., blue/cold extremities), sometimes at cumulative doses in the 0.6–1.8 g range over hours. Cease use if these signs appear and warm/rest; seek care if pain, pallor, or numbness persists.\n- Intranasal use commonly causes marked burning, nosebleeds, and sinus issues; harm reduction includes finely crushing, using small lines, alternating nostrils, and gentle saline rinses post‑session. Many switch to oral due to nasal injury.\n- Injection is associated with higher risk of severe local and systemic harm (vasoconstriction, tissue injury, infections). Use of synthetic cathinones by injection is reported but uncommon; if it occurs, sterile supplies and very dilute test doses are essential. Strongly discouraged.\n- Hydration: as with other serotonergic stimulants (e.g., MDMA), over‑ or under‑hydration can be dangerous. Sip ~250 mL water per hour at rest (up to ~500 mL/h if dancing/very active) with electrolytes; avoid excessive water without salts to reduce hyponatremia risk.\n- Redosing strategy: spacing doses by at least 2–3 h and capping total session amounts reduces cumulative strain and comedown severity. Many reports describe binges of 0.5–2 g when redosing every 30–90 min—avoid this pattern.\n- Bruxism/jaw tension is common with stimulants; gum, conscious jaw relaxation, and adequate magnesium status may help some users, but evidence is largely anecdotal. Lowering dose remains the most reliable mitigation.\n- Sleep, mood, and appetite often deteriorate after sessions; plan recovery time, nutrition, and sleep hygiene. Seek medical care for chest pain, hyperthermia, agitation not relieved by rest, or persistent psychotic symptoms. ",

    "notes": "3-MeO-PCPr is a potent, understudied arylcyclohexylamine; individual sensitivity varies markedly, so cautious titration is essential. Effects can feel deceptively functional and stimulating compared with ketamine, which increases the risk of ambulatory delirium, mania, and hazardous decision-making at higher doses. Start with a low allergy test (≤1 mg) and wait a full onset window before any redose; redosing during the come-up is a common route to overdosing on 3-MeO–substituted compounds. Because accurate weighing below ~10 mg is difficult for many consumer scales, volumetric dosing is strongly recommended to prevent accidental multi‑x dosing. Expect a long tail; residual stimulation, disequilibrium, and afterglow can persist into the next day, so avoid driving or safety‑critical tasks for at least 12–24 hours after significant dosing. Mixing with CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, opioids) increases accident risk and can compound sedation or blackouts despite a ‘stimulating’ body feel. Combining with stimulants or psychedelics substantially raises the likelihood of anxiety, delusional thinking, and psychosis; several case narratives with 3‑MeO‑PCP analogues report extreme psychosis at strong doses and when mixed. As with other dissociatives, repeated or heavy use may contribute to lower urinary tract symptoms (urgency, pain, frequency); reduce frequency, hydrate, and discontinue if symptoms emerge. Substitution/mislabeling is common in the dissociative market—use professional drug checking where available; reagent kits have limitations for this class. Intranasal use can be harsh: finely crush, use small lines, and irrigate with isotonic saline before/after to limit mucosal injury. Tolerance to dissociatives builds rapidly and can persist for days to weeks; cross‑tolerance is expected across arylcyclohexylamines. Those with a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis should avoid due to the elevated mania/psychosis risk.",

Onset—especially intranasal—can be delayed 40–90+ minutes; redosing during the come‑up is a common trigger for blackouts and hazardous behavior. Several experienced users and moderators note unusually prominent muscle tension/soreness after higher doses; spacing sessions reduces cumulative strain. Intranasal use is often caustic and can inflame sinuses; oral routes are gentler on mucosa. Mislabeling/adulteration has been documented in the wild (e.g., MD‑PiHP sold as 3‑HO‑PCP); use professional drug checking when possible, and do not assume reagent tests can definitively identify PCP analogues. The compound’s opioid receptor profile in vitro is debated; regardless, mixing with CNS depressants increases sedation and slows breathing—avoid these combinations. Dissociatives in general can aggravate mood instability, mania, and psychosis; people with a history of these should avoid or use only with strong support and conservative dosing in a safe setting. Heavy, frequent dissociative use (well‑established for ketamine) is linked to urinary tract problems; while specific data for 3‑HO‑PCP are limited, adopt the same precautions—hydrate, avoid daily use, and stop if urinary symptoms appear. Because ambulation can be preserved while judgment is impaired, trips should be done sitting/lying down with a sober sitter available to prevent accidents.",

    "notes": "O-DSMT is the main active metabolite (M1) of tramadol with much higher μ‑opioid receptor affinity than the parent drug; its effects are therefore more purely opioid-like and less serotonergic than tramadol, but potency and response vary widely across individuals. Community and forensic reports show that unregulated opioid products can be adulterated with potent synthetic opioids (e.g., nitazenes) or benzodiazepines; use drug-checking services where available and treat unknown powders/pills as potentially stronger than expected. Avoid polydrug use with CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, barbiturates, Z‑drugs, GHB/GBL): these combinations are a leading cause of fatal opioid overdoses due to synergistic respiratory depression. DXM with opioids is flagged as dangerous in harm‑reduction guidance; avoid this mix. Although O‑DSMT lacks tramadol’s marked serotonin reuptake inhibition, mixing with serotonergic agents (e.g., MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, linezolid, MDMA) still warrants caution because product mislabeling/adulteration and individual pharmacodynamics vary. Insufflation accelerates onset and can encourage redosing; this raises stacking/overdose risk—measure doses precisely, avoid frequent redoses, and wait through the peak before considering more. Seizures have been reported anecdotally with O‑DSMT—risk increases with stimulant use, sleep deprivation, high doses, or benzodiazepine withdrawal; avoid these conditions and keep doses conservative. Carry naloxone and ensure people around you know how to use it; naloxone may need repeat dosing and emergency services should always be called—place the person in the recovery position and monitor breathing. If injecting any drug, use new sterile equipment every time and never share; however, IV/IM use of O‑DSMT is strongly discouraged due to solubility uncertainties, particulate/excipient risks, and high overdose potential. Avoid using alone; if you do, consider remote supervision (e.g., phone/video) and set check‑ins. To reduce dependence risks, avoid multi‑day runs; tolerance and withdrawal (restless legs, insomnia, flu‑like symptoms, dysphoria) can emerge after just several days of heavy use—space sessions and plan breaks. Because human pharmacokinetic data are limited and supply is variable, treat published dosing/onset ranges as rough guides only.",

    "notes": "Rationale for updated harm reduction and medical-use guidance:\n- Cardiac valvulopathy mechanism: Fenfluramine’s active metabolite norfenfluramine is a potent 5‑HT2B agonist on heart valves; activation drives fibroblast proliferation and valvular thickening. This mechanistic link is supported by receptor-binding and functional assays and is widely accepted as the likely cause of fenfluramine-associated valvular heart disease (VHD). Therefore, any non‑medical use is high risk, and medical use generally requires baseline and periodic echocardiography under restricted programs.\n- Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been associated historically with fenfluramine/dexfenfluramine exposure; although RCTs in Dravet syndrome did not detect PAH over short durations, the risk justifies ongoing cardiopulmonary monitoring and symptom education (dyspnea, syncope, edema).\n- Dosing must follow mg/kg regimens used in epilepsy trials/labels: typical titration is from 0.1 mg/kg/day to 0.35 mg/kg/day in divided doses, with lower maxima when co‑administered with stiripentol + clobazam; exceeding these regimens increases cardiotoxic risk.\n- Serotonergic risk: Fenfluramine increases extracellular serotonin and carries a stated risk of potentially fatal serotonin syndrome; combining with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, triptans, or serotonin releasers markedly elevates risk. Educate users to avoid such combinations and to recognize red‑flag symptoms (agitation, hyperthermia, clonus).\n- Pharmacokinetics and interactions: Oral absorption is unaffected by food; elimination half‑life is ~20 h; it is metabolized by multiple CYPs (1A2, 2B6, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5). This supports caution with strong inhibitors/inducers and justifies slow titration and tapering to avoid adverse effects or seizure destabilization.\n- Sedation and anorexia are common adverse effects in RCTs; in pediatric patients, monitor weight, nutritional status, and fall risk; advise against driving/operating machinery during initiation/titration due to somnolence/ataxia.\n- Restricted access programs (e.g., REMS) exist due to VHD/PAH risk; this underscores the need for supervised use and routine echocardiography.\n- Discontinuation should be gradual to limit rebound issues (including seizure destabilization in treated populations).\n\nHarm-reduction additions applied to the JSON above reflect these points: dosing corrected to mg/kg/day with stiripentol-specific maxima; interactions expanded with serotonergic, CYP, and CNS depressant cautions; subjective effects adjusted toward sedation/anorexia rather than stimulation; and notes emphasize cardiac monitoring and avoidance of non‑medical use.",

Reagent sets (e.g., Marquis + Simon’s, Froehde, Zimmermann/Morris) can help screen cathinones but cannot confirm identity—use FT‑IR/GC‑MS if possible. Vaporizing the hydrochloride salt is reported to be especially caustic; airway irritation and chest burn are common when overheated—gentle, indirect heat and good ventilation reduce harm. Finely triturating crystals and pre/post isotonic saline rinses can reduce nasal damage if insufflating. Redose spacing and session time‑limits reduce escalation toward sleep loss, paranoia, and stimulant psychosis; plan sleep and nutrition before starting. Maintain hydration and electrolytes; avoid hot environments and heavy exertion because stimulants impair heat dissipation and increase hyperthermia risk. Seizures, severe hypertension, and hyperthermia have been reported with synthetic cathinones in general—seek urgent care if confusion, very high temperature, chest pain, or seizures occur. Compulsive redosing is a well‑documented risk with pyrrolidinophenones; consider pre‑measured doses and avoid open‑bag use to limit binges. Use an accurate milligram scale; for very small amounts or to allergy‑test, use volumetric dosing to avoid overmeasuring. Never mix with MAOIs; be extra cautious with tramadol or bupropion due to seizure risk. After sessions, prioritize rest, gentle refeeding, and hydration; OTC sleep aids with known interactions avoided may help—avoid mixing depressants if already sedated by exhaustion.",

    "notes": "Extremely limited human data exist for 2C‑EF. Identity verification is crucial: reagent tests can suggest a 2C‑x class but are not confirmatory; recent community tests on real‑world 2C‑EF tablets/powders showed inconsistent single‑reagent colours (e.g., Marquis no reaction; Froehde light green; Mecke light purple/pink; Liebermann olive green), so rely on multi‑reagent screening and, when possible, FTIR/GC‑MS/NMR drug‑checking rather than colour tests alone. A 2024 H‑NMR plus external UHPLC‑MS confirmation post supported that authentic 2C‑EF is circulating, while separate community reports cautioned that some blue 10 mg ‘2C‑EF’ tablets in NL tested as 2C‑T—underscoring the need to test each batch. Onset may be delayed up to ~2 hours; avoid redosing during the come‑up to prevent unexpectedly strong peaks. As with related 2C‑x phenethylamines, transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure, muscle tension/twitches, chills, and vasoconstrictive sensations can occur; those with cardiovascular risk should use extra caution. Combining with MAOIs can dangerously potentiate phenethylamines and raise hypertensive/serotonergic risks; tramadol (serotonergic and seizure risk) and DXM (serotonergic) are also high‑risk combinations. SSRIs/SNRIs frequently blunt serotonergic psychedelic effects; people on these medicines may report muted or atypical responses. Insufflation of 2C‑x is widely reported as extremely painful and is discouraged due to causticity and unpredictable absorption; avoid nasal ROA for 2C‑EF. Store the salt form dry, airtight, protected from light, and cold; avoid moisture and temperature cycling (let sealed containers warm to room temp before opening) to minimize degradation. Use precise measurement (mg scale) and consider volumetric dosing for accuracy; avoid eyeballing. Always plan set and setting, avoid driving/unsafe tasks, and keep a benzodiazepine available for severe agitation—recognizing it will also attenuate the psychedelic.",

Expect occasional mislabeling and mixtures—use professional drug checking where available.\n- Reagent kits often cannot confirm identity within the pyrrolidinophenone family; lab analysis (FTIR/GC–MS) from a drug‑checking service is preferred. Saferparty has documented MDPPP and other cathinones sold as something else, illustrating frequent misrepresentation.\n- Overheating and hot environments markedly increase risk with stimulants; plan cool‑down breaks, light clothing, and paced activity. Maintain fluids with electrolytes but avoid overhydration (rough guide: ~250 ml/hour at rest; up to ~500 ml/hour if heavily active).\n- Vasoconstriction and peripheral coldness are common; avoid additional vasoconstrictors (decongestants, nicotine binges) and monitor extremity color/temperature. If fingers/toes become pale or painful, stop use, warm gradually, hydrate, and rest.\n- For nasal use, finely crush, use your own sterile straw/spoon, alternate nostrils, and rinse with isotonic saline pre/post to reduce mucosal injury and bleeding risk.\n- For inhalation, only vaporize the freebase in glass with gentle heat; harsh flame promotes pyrolysis and toxic/by‑product inhalation. Expect very fast onset and high craving—pre‑weigh single‑use doses and lock away the rest to limit binges.\n- Sleep loss is a major driver of psychosis. Plan sessions so you can sleep within 12–18 h; if unable to sleep, prioritize hydration, food, dark/quiet environment, and non‑pharmacologic sleep hygiene. Avoid stacking downers to force sleep; seek medical care if agitation, chest pain, or >39 °C (102.2 °F) fever occurs.\n- Do not combine with MAOIs; stimulant + MAOI combinations are flagged as dangerous in harm‑reduction combo references.\n- Tramadol, DXM, and bupropion lower seizure threshold or add catecholaminergic load—avoid mixing.\n- Because formal human PK is lacking, assume interindividual variability; those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, seizure history, or pregnancy should avoid use.

    "notes": "PCA is used as a research tool to selectively ablate serotonergic axon terminals; authoritative biomedical descriptors classify it as a potent serotonergic neurotoxin rather than a therapeutic or recreational agent. In rodents, PCA causes marked, long‑lasting reductions in serotonergic markers and selective degeneration of dorsal raphe projections after single exposures; behavioral sensitization to other psychostimulants can persist for weeks, indicating durable neuroadaptations. Its neurotoxicity likely involves oxidative metabolic activation to reactive intermediates in liver and brain microsomes and massive 5‑HT release producing downstream excitotoxic/oxidative stress. Because the hazard stems from the mechanism (powerful SERT‑mediated release plus toxic metabolites), combining PCA with any serotonergic drug (MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, MDMA, DXM, tramadol, triptans, linezolid/methylene blue, St John’s wort) greatly amplifies risks of serotonin syndrome and hyperthermia. Even brief physical exertion or hot venues can worsen hyperthermia; cooling, rest, and conservative fluid intake (small, regular sips; avoid overhydration) are essential if unintentional exposure occurs. Community harm‑reduction alerts (2023–2025) have reported vendors listing closely related para‑chloroamphetamines (e.g., 4‑CMA) and warn of potential adulteration/substitution; verified lab drug checking is strongly advised if a stimulant of uncertain identity is encountered. If exposure occurs, avoid redosing and other serotonergics for at least several days; seek medical help urgently for agitation, muscle rigidity, high fever, confusion, or rapid heart rate suggestive of serotonin toxicity. Individuals with hepatic disease may be at increased risk given P450‑mediated bioactivation. Overall, PCA presents a realistic risk of lasting serotonergic injury in mammals; from a harm‑reduction standpoint, avoidance and rigorous drug checking are the principal risk‑mitigation strategies.",

    "notes": "- Test and verify substance identity: DMT is an indole and typically reacts positive with indole-sensitive reagents (e.g., Ehrlich), but reagent color alone cannot prove purity; formal drug checking is preferred. Mislabeling between N,N-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT has led to overdoses due to very different potency and effects profiles.\n- Vaporization technique matters: use heat, not direct flame; pre-measure with a mg-accurate scale; expect that melted residue can linger in glassware and cause unexpected extra milligrams later. Sit or lie down before the last inhalation to avoid falls due to rapid incapacitation.\n- Cardiovascular effects (transient hypertension/tachycardia) are common at psychoactive doses; screen for uncontrolled hypertension, significant cardiac disease, or recent stimulant use; avoid combining with vasopressors or strong stimulants.\n- Oral DMT requires MAO-A inhibition; this markedly increases duration/intensity and interaction risks. Avoid serotonergic medications (SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs), tramadol, meperidine, DXM, and stimulant drugs for an adequate washout period when MAOIs are involved. Some foods high in tyramine can pose added risk with prescription/strong MAOIs.\n- Mental health cautions: strong psychedelics can precipitate or exacerbate psychosis or mania in vulnerable individuals; those with personal/family history of psychotic or bipolar disorders should avoid or proceed only with clinical oversight.\n- Sitter and environment: due to near-instant onset, a sober sitter should remove hot devices and protect from falls. Use in a quiet, seated/lying setting with minimal obstacles.\n- Avoid redosing loops: acute tolerance is minimal with DMT compared to LSD/psilocybin; however, repeated back-to-back inhalations can stack cardiovascular/psychological load without providing integration time.\n- Changa (DMT on MAOI-containing herbs) typically requires slightly lower DMT doses and lasts longer than freebase alone; interaction cautions of harmalas apply.\n- Pulmonary irritation is common with hot or combusted vapor; lower-temperature vaporization and cooling the vapor (e.g., water piece) can reduce airway discomfort; individuals with reactive airway disease should be cautious.\n- Distinguish N,N-DMT from 5-MeO-DMT: 5-MeO-DMT is active at much lower doses and carries higher risk of severe adverse reactions, particularly with MAOIs. Never assume marketed “DMT” is N,N-DMT; verify before dosing.\n- Drug checking services (where available) can detect adulterants and misrepresentation; several European services have reported misdeclared tryptamine products, underscoring the need for verification before use.",

    "notes": "Rationale 1 — Dosing ranges and redosing lag: Swiss harm‑reduction guidance lists BDO oral ‘low/common/high’ bands of roughly 0.5–1.0 mL, 1.0–2.5 mL, and 2.5–4.0 mL, with >4 mL commonly producing unrousable sleep; they explicitly advise not to redose for at least 2 hours because delayed stacking is a frequent cause of overdose. This directly supports using lower mL ranges than many forum norms and emphasising strict redose timing.\nRationale 2 — Measurement accuracy and timing: Community HR materials recommend measuring in millilitres with an oral syringe, recording dose times, and using timers to avoid premature redoses. This is consistent with the steep dose–response of GHB/GBL/BDO and common blackout/redose loops.\nRationale 3 — Alcohol (ethanol) interaction: BDO is converted to GHB primarily by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH); ethanol competes at ADH and can delay conversion while adding CNS depression, producing delayed, prolonged, and more toxic effects when the backlog converts. Controlled human/animal/PK data and clinical texts document the ADH pathway and ethanol’s inhibition. This justifies flagging alcohol as a uniquely dangerous interaction and advising long redose delays.\nRationale 4 — Inter‑individual variability: Human data (including ADH polymorphisms) show marked variability in conversion and clearance, meaning equal mL doses can have very different effects across people and even across sessions. This supports conservative first‑dose ranges and avoiding dose‑sharing.\nRationale 5 — Depressant combinations: Emergency and HR sources stress that combining GHB/GBL/BDO with opioids, benzodiazepines, or other depressants drastically increases respiratory depression and ICU admissions; guidance is to avoid all depressant polydrug use. This underpins the ‘dangerous/unsafe’ interaction categories.\nRationale 6 — Overdose recognition and first aid: HR organisations advise never leaving a sedated person alone, placing unresponsive users in the recovery position, avoiding fluids by mouth when unconscious, and calling emergency services promptly due to airway/aspiration risk. Including these steps is essential because many BDO poisonings involve aspiration or respiratory compromise.\nRationale 7 — Product quality and checking: BDO is an industrial solvent and not pharmaceutically standardised in recreational markets; drug checking programmes list BDO among analyzable submissions, and some services now specifically accept GHB/GBL/BDO liquids. Encouraging analysis and labelling helps reduce misidentification, contamination, and concentration errors.\nRationale 8 — Density and unit pitfalls: BDO’s density is slightly above water (~1.017 g/mL at 20 °C). Conversions between mL and grams therefore differ from water and vary with temperature; using mL syringes (not spoons) and standardising dilution reduces dosing error.\nRationale 9 — Medical/toxicology context: Clinical and forensic literature ties BDO to severe intoxication and withdrawal, with fatal cases reported at gram‑range doses; toxicology often detects GHB rather than the parent due to rapid conversion. Including these realities warns users that ‘it’s just a solvent’ is a dangerous myth.\nRationale 10 — Pharmacology caveats (antidotes/enzymes): Human crossover work confirms that the ADH inhibitor fomepizole markedly reduces conversion of BDO to GHB. This is clinically relevant for hospitals but is not a self‑care tool; the note discourages lay experimentation and explains why ethanol ‘seems to delay’ onset.\n\nIntegrated guidance: 1,4‑BDO is a GHB prodrug with a steep dose–response and variable metabolism. Always measure with a 1 mL syringe, dose yourself only, label containers, and record times. Start 0.5–1.0 mL on an empty stomach and wait ≥2 h before any redose. Never combine with alcohol, benzos, opioids, or other sedatives. Avoid back‑to‑back days; physical dependence can develop quickly, and sudden cessation after round‑the‑clock use can be life‑threatening. If someone becomes unresponsive, don’t give anything by mouth; place them in the recovery position and call EMS.",

    "notes": "Harm‑reduction rationale and key guidance (with sources): 1) Mislabeling/adulteration: O‑PCE has been repeatedly sold as “ketamine,” creating overdose risk due to higher potency and longer duration; Swiss drug‑checking issued a 2025 alert for 2‑Oxo‑PCE sold as ketamine and warned it may be 3–4× stronger with longer effects. Always use a trusted drug‑checking service before use. 2) Acute toxicity profile: a 2017 outbreak (n=56) found predominant impaired consciousness (84%), confusion (60%), hypertension (80%), tachycardia (40%), and convulsions (16%) with confirmed O‑PCE as sole agent in many cases; management was supportive. Avoid if you have uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or seizure history. 3) Duration can outlast ketamine: community HR sources report 2–5 h (IN) and 3–6+ h (oral) with after‑effects up to 1–2 days; some services warn 6–10 h at higher doses. Plan set/setting, avoid driving/operating machinery for the rest of the day, and keep a sober sitter for higher doses. 4) Redosing risks: slow come‑up and long plateaus make stacking common; wait at least 60–120 min (IN) or 2–3 h (oral) before considering any additional dosing to avoid unexpectedly deep dissociation or holes. 5) Depressant combinations (alcohol, benzos, opioids, GHB) increase sedation, confusion and aspiration risk; avoid these mixes. General combo guidance flags dissociative+depressant as risky. Carry naloxone if opioids may be present in your supply. 6) Stimulant and polysubstance use: stimulants may exacerbate O‑PCE‑related hypertension, anxiety, and mania‑like states; polysubstance cases were common in outbreaks. Titrate especially cautiously if any stimulant is onboard. 7) Bladder/urinary risk likely extends to this class: ketamine cystitis is well‑documented and can progress to severe LUTS and renal complications; while direct O‑PCE data are limited, class‑based caution (limit frequency, hydrate, seek care early if urinary symptoms emerge) is prudent. Avoid if you currently have a UTI. 8) Nasal harm reduction: finely crush, use your own straw, and rinse with sterile water/saline before and after to reduce mucosal damage; repeated snorting can injure septum. Consider oral dosing to reduce local damage. 9) Tolerance and compulsive use: arylcyclohexylamines can produce rapid tolerance (days) with partial reset over 1–2 weeks; spacing sessions helps reduce escalation and dependence risk. 10) Market variability and isomer confusion: fluorinated analogs (e.g., “FXE”) have been widely misidentified in the unregulated market; this underscores the need for professional analysis rather than assuming identity from vendor labels.

This places it in the ketamine/PCx family with likely NMDA receptor antagonism; human pharmacokinetics remain poorly characterized. • Mislabeling risk: Drug checking services have found DMXE sold as MXE; do not assume a vendor or pellet label is accurate—use reagent/lab testing where available. • Combining CNS depressants (alcohol, GHB/GBL, opioids) with dissociatives markedly increases risks of loss of consciousness, aspiration and respiratory depression; if someone becomes unresponsive, place them in the recovery position and seek help. • Benzodiazepines and dissociatives potentiate each other’s sedation/ataxia and can lead to unexpected blackouts at high doses; treat as a caution-only combination. • Stimulant or serotonergic co-use (e.g., MDMA/SSRIs) can produce unpredictable effects (e.g., anxiety, blood-pressure elevation, or unusual mood shifts), and MXE analogs have specific MAOI/SSRI cautions—avoid such mixes or proceed only with expert-level caution. • Repeated/frequent dissociative use is linked to urinary tract (‘ketamine cystitis’) and biliary complications with ketamine; similar risks may generalize to analogs—watch for urinary urgency, pain or blood; take prolonged breaks and stop use if symptoms appear. • Expect marked motor impairment and poor situational awareness—clear hazards, stay seated/lying at higher doses, and never drive. General dissociative harm-reduction stresses environment control and moderation. • Intranasal use: crush finely; avoid shared/contaminated implements; rinse with sterile saline before/after to reduce mucosal damage. • Potency and duration vary by batch and route; some users report prolonged residual dissociation after high cumulative dosing or all‑night redosing—resist the urge to ‘chase the hole’ and allow full plateaus to resolve before considering more. • The smell or color of product (e.g., tan/odorous powder, black/grey pellets) is not a quality guarantee and may reflect impurities or excipients; lab testing beats home ‘purification’ hacks.

    "notes": "Always verify identity and purity: use a multi‑step reagent sequence (e.g., Marquis→Mecke→Simon’s) and, where available, take advantage of FT‑IR/GC‑MS drug‑checking services; cathinones and PMA/PMMA have been repeatedly found in the market and can be lethal at typical MDMA doses. Start with a single, conservative dose and avoid redosing; MDMA displays non‑linear pharmacokinetics (CYP2D6 auto‑inhibition), so redoses can produce disproportionate plasma increases and toxicity. Maintain a moderate ambient temperature and take regular cool‑down breaks, especially when dancing; MDMA impairs thermoregulation and increases heat production, raising hyperthermia risk in hot, crowded venues. Hydration: sip isotonic fluids rather than plain water; typical harm‑reduction guidance is ≤500 mL/h when active and ~250 mL/h when resting to reduce hyponatremia risk. Hyponatremia risk is increased by excessive hypotonic fluid intake, MDMA‑induced vasopressin release, and is reported more often in females and in those on SSRIs/SNRIs. Avoid combining with serotonergic agents (MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM, linezolid) due to serotonin toxicity risk; seek urgent care for agitation, clonus, hyperthermia, heavy sweating, or confusion. Certain medicines (fluoxetine/paroxetine/quinidine; ritonavir/cobicistat) can markedly elevate MDMA blood levels via CYP inhibition—use is strongly discouraged. People with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, epilepsy, or bipolar disorder are at higher risk of adverse events; sleep deprivation and dehydration further increase risk. Do not take 5‑HTP or other serotonergic supplements within 24 h before/after MDMA due to possible serotonin excess; magnesium may reduce bruxism in some users but evidence is limited. Post‑use mood dips and sleep disruption are common for 1–3 days; plan for rest, nutrition, and gentle rehydration; frequent use (e.g., <4–6 weeks between sessions) is associated with more pronounced after‑effects. Pill/tablet strengths vary widely (including 200–300 mg units); weigh powders and do not assume pill logos indicate content.",

Onset can be delayed up to ~2 hours; do not redose for at least 3 hours to avoid accidental overdose, a known risk with DOx compounds. The long duration (often half a day or more) can be psychologically and physically taxing; plan set, setting, sleep, and nutrition accordingly. DOx compounds can produce vasoconstriction and cardiovascular strain; cold, numb extremities, severe headache, chest pain, or tingling warrant stopping further use and seeking medical attention. Avoid combining with additional stimulants (including high caffeine or nicotine) as this can worsen blood pressure, anxiety, and body load. Combining with serotonergic agents that lower seizure threshold (e.g., tramadol, DXM) or increase synaptic serotonin (e.g., MAOIs) can be dangerous; avoid these entirely. SSRIs may blunt psychedelic effects but also add serotonergic load; if present, keep DOEF doses low and avoid other serotonergic combinations. Mixing in downers (alcohol, benzodiazepines) to ‘end’ a long DOx experience increases accident and blackout risk; if used at all, extremely small amounts and only after the peak with a sober sitter, though avoidance is safer. Because potency is in the low-milligram range, weigh with a calibrated 1 mg scale and consider volumetric dosing to reduce measurement error. Mislabeling within the DOx family has occurred historically; reagent kits cannot reliably distinguish specific DOx, and only lab drug checking (FTIR/GC-MS) can confirm identity—submit a tiny sample of powder or blotter when possible. Individuals with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or a history of panic/psychosis should avoid DOEF due to prolonged stimulation and psychological intensity.",

Red‑blood‑cell hydrolysis and PEPT1‑mediated intestinal transport underlie its smoother PK profile. (2) Food may delay Tmax by ~1 hour without meaningfully changing exposure; overall exposure and effect are more sensitive to urinary pH: acidification increases amphetamine elimination and weakens effects; alkalinization reduces elimination and can potentiate them (including with antacids). (3) Absolute contraindication with MAOIs and agents with MAOI activity (linezolid, methylene blue); risk includes hypertensive crisis and serotonin toxicity—observe 14‑day washout. (4) Concomitant SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs are not automatically contraindicated but do raise serotonin‑toxicity and pressor risks; use of stimulants with potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion) can elevate amphetamine exposure—monitor or avoid unsupervised combinations. (5) Additive sympathomimetic effects occur with OTC decongestants (pseudoephedrine/phenylephrine) and caffeine; even modest pseudoephedrine doses increase heart rate and slightly raise systolic BP. Avoid when possible. (6) Alcohol co‑use increases cardiovascular stress and impairs risk perception; stimulants are implicated in hypertensive crises and arrhythmias at high doses or with co‑ingestants—avoid mixing. (7) Peripheral vasculopathy (e.g., Raynaud phenomenon) has been reported during stimulant therapy; monitor for cold, numb, or discolored fingers/toes. (8) Psychiatric risks (anxiety, agitation, mania, psychosis) scale with dose/frequency; large cohort data suggest prescription stimulant–associated psychosis in ~1/660 adolescents/young adults, with amphetamines risk > methylphenidate. Stop escalation and seek care if hallucinations or delusions emerge. (9) Hydration, rest, and temperature management reduce hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis risk during prolonged exertion on stimulants; urgent care is warranted for severe headache, chest pain, confusion, or overheating. (10) Pediatric users require growth monitoring; long‑term stimulant therapy is associated with small but measurable reductions in growth velocity. (11) Pregnancy/lactation: amphetamines cross into milk and have stimulant effects; discuss risks vs benefits with a clinician before use in these states. (12) Plan dosing timing to protect sleep (early morning dosing; avoid late‑day redosing). Insomnia worsens cardiovascular and anxiety risks. (13) Dry mouth and bruxism are common; frequent water, sugar‑free gum, and mouth care reduce dental risk. (14) Avoid polydrug stacks with additional stimulants or serotonergics; when on necessary interacting meds (e.g., SSRI), keep doses conservative and add BP/HR checks.",

Evidence: vendor and user discussions on Bluelight.\nInjectable routes: multiple community reports describe seizures at very high intramuscular doses (≈80–100 mg+). Because this compound lacks human PK/PD data and sterile formulation guidance, avoid IM/IV; if someone ignores this advice, using clinical-grade sterile technique and conservative dosing is critical. Evidence: recent user thread collating seizure reports.\nCNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzos, GHB/GBL) markedly increase risks of blackout, aspiration, and respiratory depression with ketamine-like dissociatives; treat these combos as dangerous. Evidence: TripSit combination guidance (ketamine proxies).\nStacking dissociatives (e.g., DXM, nitrous, ketamine analogues) can amplify ataxia, delirium, hypoxia, and amnesia. If nitrous is used, keep sessions brief, seated, and spaced—heavy or repeated nitrous exposure inactivates vitamin B12 and can cause neuropathy. Evidence: TripSit combos; DrugWise/EUDA nitrous overview.\nSeizure-threshold–lowering medicines (tramadol, bupropion) warrant extra caution; avoid high doses and combinations that add sleep deprivation or stimulants. Evidence: StatPearls/LiverTox monographs.\nNasal care for insufflation: finely crush, use your own clean straw, rinse with water before/after, alternate nostrils, and rest your nose to reduce bleeding and septal injury. Evidence: Hi‑Ground harm‑reduction pages.\nBladder and biliary risks: heavy/frequent arylcyclohexylamine use (well-documented for ketamine) can lead to ulcerative cystitis and, more rarely, hepatobiliary injury. Space sessions (weeks, not days), hydrate, and stop use if urinary urgency/pain or right‑upper‑quadrant pain occurs; seek medical evaluation. Evidence: StatPearls and LiverTox.\nImpairment: dissociatives robustly impair coordination and judgment; plan a safe setting, sober sitter at high doses, and no driving/operating machinery until the following day. Evidence: StatPearls; DrugWise.\nDrug checking: the unregulated market shows frequent mislabeling and adulteration across dissociative/stimulant categories. Use a trusted drug‑checking service where available; reagent tests are helpful but may not distinguish closely related arylcyclohexylamines. Evidence: EUDA DIMS report; Toronto Drug Checking Service.\nCompulsive redosing risk: many users report rapid tolerance and habit-forming patterns similar to MXE. Set firm maximums per session and leave multi-day washouts to mitigate escalation. Evidence: Bluelight MXiPr thread.",

    "notes": "• Misrepresentation: NBOH/NBOMe blotters have repeatedly been sold as LSD; microgram doses plus uneven laying raise overdose risk. Do not assume unknown blotter is LSD; use reagents and drug checking when available. • Testing: Use indole‑detecting reagents (Ehrlich or Hofmann) to confirm lysergamide; Marquis does not react with LSD but can show reactions with many NBOMe/NBOH—use both types to discriminate. UV fluorescence can help (LSD fluoresces; NBOMe/NBOH often do not). • Oral ‘inactivity’ myth: Swallowing NBOH/NBOMe is not a reliable way to avoid effects; oral activity is variable. Treat any unknown blotter as potentially active when swallowed. • Volumetric dosing: Never eyeball powder or highly concentrated solutions. For any handling beyond pre‑laid blotters, pre‑dilute to a known µg/mL and measure by volume; avoid powder insufflation because typical milligram scales cannot resolve safe microgram doses. • Intranasal caution: Faster onset but more adverse effects; cluster reports with 25B‑NBOH include status epilepticus following insufflation. Prefer transmucosal over intranasal and avoid powders. • Cardiovascular strain: Vasoconstriction and tachycardia are common; combining with stimulants or vasoconstrictive decongestants increases risk. Screen for personal/family cardiovascular disease and hydrate, keep cool, and avoid redosing. • Lithium: Psychedelics plus lithium have repeatedly been linked to seizures and medical emergencies; avoid entirely. • Tramadol: Lowers seizure threshold and has produced seizures in combinations with other psychoactives; avoid. • Synergy with LSD/other psychedelics: Users report extreme potentiation; do not combine on a first exposure. Cross‑tolerance can still leave side‑effect risk at similar doses. • HPPD risk: NBOMe/NBOH use is anecdotally associated with a relatively higher incidence of lingering visual phenomena; minimize frequency, dose, and avoid sleep deprivation. • Storage/handling: Protect blotters/solutions from heat and light; label clearly to prevent accidental ingestion by others. Case anecdotes describe severe outcomes after accidental dosing from mislabeled bottles.",

Test samples via a trusted drug checking service; note that home reagents often cannot distinguish between specific cathinones. If severe agitation, chest pain, confusion, or overheating occur, seek emergency care; medical management of sympathomimetic toxicity typically prioritizes benzodiazepines for sedation, cooling, IV fluids, and monitoring—do not rely on self‑administered sedatives. Avoid combining with MAOIs or additional stimulants; these combinations substantially increase risks of hypertensive crisis, hyperthermia, seizures, and arrhythmias. Hydrate with electrolytes and take cooling breaks during physical activity, but avoid overconsumption of plain water to reduce hyponatremia risk. Injecting carries high risks (infection, blood‑borne viruses, rapid toxicity); if injecting, always use sterile equipment and never share; safer‑use facilities may offer supervised spaces and supplies in some regions. Do not drive or operate machinery during effects or comedown; stimulants impair judgment during the rise and can leave rebound fatigue and anxiety as they wear off. Dependence risk is significant; plan sessions with hard stopping rules (no access to stash; alarms to stop; prearranged sleep and nutrition) and long breaks between uses.",

Oral bioavailability is high (≥90%), shows linear PK, Tmax ≈ 1.5 h fasting, and the drug is excreted renally largely unchanged; dose reduction is required in CKD. Evidence: pharmacology reviews and drug databases.\n— Respiratory risk with depressants: On its own, severe respiratory depression is uncommon, but gabapentinoids plus opioids/other depressants are repeatedly over‑represented in ED overdose cohorts; intubation/antidotes were frequently needed in polysubstance cases. Treat the combo as high risk.\n— Rapid tolerance/redose trap: Many users report that same‑day redoses add little desired effect but increase dyscoordination and blackout‑type sedation; spacing uses by ≥1–2 weeks is commonly reported to restore effects. This pattern is harm‑reduction relevant to limit escalation.\n— Withdrawal & dependence: Abrupt cessation after days–weeks of frequent/high‑dose use can produce anxiety/insomnia, autonomic signs, dysphoria, and in severe cases confusion or psychotic features; tapering is strongly preferred. Case series and large user communities document multi‑week courses when heavily dependent.\n— Seizure caution with tramadol: Community and trip-report data include convulsions when pregabalin was combined with tramadol; avoid the combo and other seizure‑threshold‑lowering agents, especially during withdrawal.\n— Driving/coordination: Dizziness, ataxia, diplopia, and delayed reaction times are common at recreational doses; do not drive or operate machinery during the day of use and while residual sedation persists.\n— Route of administration: Oral is efficient; intranasal/rectal routes are anecdotal and offer no proven advantage, with additional local risks. Avoid IV due to insoluble fillers and embolic risk.\n— Mixing with opioids: If someone uses both despite warnings, reduce usual opioid dose substantially, avoid concurrent benzodiazepines/alcohol, have an awake sober observer, and place the person in recovery position if heavily sedated; naloxone should be available for opioid users. This reflects the observed overdose patterns in polysubstance cases.\n— Renal harm‑reduction: Because elimination is renal and unchanged, people with eGFR reduction accumulate drug; they should use lower/fewer doses and longer spacing. Seek medical dosing advice if any kidney disease is present. ",

    "notes": "Harm-reduction essentials: (1) Potency and amnesia: flunitrazepam is a powerful hypnotic; small dose increments can cause profound sedation and anterograde amnesia, especially above ~1–2 mg. Avoid redosing during the first several hours because the peak may be delayed and effects accumulate with its long half-life. Evidence: HR organizations and pharmacology summaries report rapid onset, strong amnesia and long duration. (2) Mixing with depressants: combining benzodiazepines with alcohol, opioids, or GHB/GBL greatly increases the risk of respiratory depression, loss of consciousness, aspiration, and death. Treat these combinations as high-risk and avoid. If opioids may be present, keep naloxone accessible, but note that naloxone will not reverse benzodiazepine sedation. (3) Gabapentinoids and other sedatives: pregabalin/gabapentin and sedative-hypnotics (Z-drugs, antihistamines, carisoprodol) additively increase sedation and overdose risk; co-use features prominently in European overdose monitoring. (4) Grapefruit/CYP3A4: avoid grapefruit products and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; they can raise flunitrazepam levels and prolong sedation. (5) Counterfeit risk and adulteration: tablets sold as “Rohypnol” on unregulated markets may contain other benzodiazepines or even potent synthetic opioids (e.g., nitazenes). Use trusted sources and, where available, drug checking to verify contents. (6) Overdose response: prioritize airway, breathing, and circulation; place an unconscious person in the recovery position and call emergency services. Flumazenil is not an at‑home antidote—it can precipitate dangerous seizures and withdrawal in benzodiazepine-tolerant individuals or mixed overdoses (e.g., with TCAs) and should only be considered in carefully selected medical settings. (7) Dependence and withdrawal: daily or prolonged use increases dependence risk; abrupt cessation after regular use can cause severe withdrawal and seizures. Any taper should be medically supervised; the FDA’s 2020 boxed warning for benzodiazepines underscores misuse, addiction, and withdrawal risks, especially with concurrent CNS depressants. (8) Next‑day impairment: due to an 18–26 h half-life and active metabolites, psychomotor impairment can persist into the next day—avoid driving or hazardous tasks until fully alert. (9) Sexual assault prevention and consent: never dose another person; be aware that flunitrazepam can cause hours of amnesia. Reduce victimization risk by not leaving drinks unattended, refusing unknown/open beverages, and looking out for peers. Seek immediate medical and legal assistance if drink‑tampering is suspected. (10) Populations at higher risk: older adults, people with respiratory disease or sleep apnea, and those on multiple sedatives are at heightened risk for respiratory events and falls; use extra caution or avoid.

    "notes": "Potency vs phenibut is highly variable across individuals and lots; community moderators and experienced users typically estimate 4–8× stronger by weight, with reports spanning roughly 2–10×. Given this spread, first-time doses should be conservative (≤100 mg oral) with no redose for at least 3 hours to avoid stacking toward an unexpectedly heavy peak. Scoop sizes provided by vendors are unreliable; a milligram-accurate scale is strongly advised as community testing found vendor micro-scoops could vary several-fold depending on powder density and packing. The HCl salt is acidic and commonly causes gastric irritation/heartburn; taking in capsules or with non-acidic liquid may reduce discomfort, while the FAA form is sometimes used sublingually but tastes harsh and still requires precise weighing. Insufflation is discouraged due to acidity, high dose requirements, and lack of benefit; smoking or injection are strongly contraindicated. F-Phenibut appears more sedating and shorter-acting than phenibut for many users; profound next-day somnolence has been reported after higher doses, and users should avoid driving or hazardous tasks for the rest of the day and possibly the following morning. Mixing with alcohol, GHB/GBL, benzodiazepines, opioids, or other sedatives meaningfully increases risk of blackouts, aspiration, and respiratory depression; avoid these combinations entirely. Tolerance can develop within days of repeated use; many HR communities recommend limiting use to once or twice per week with multi-day gaps to reduce dependence risk. Withdrawal after sustained or high-dose use can onset more rapidly than with phenibut (sometimes within 10–24 hours), and may include anxiety, insomnia, tachycardia, tremor, and rebound agitation; abrupt cessation from daily use is discouraged—seek medical guidance for a gradual taper. Adulteration and mislabeling occur in this market; drug checking services have found samples sold as phenibut that contained other substances (e.g., CBD), so treat unknown material cautiously and test when possible. A subset of users report paradoxical or dysphoric reactions, dizziness, and chest discomfort at higher doses; any chest pain, severe confusion, or breathing difficulty warrants urgent medical evaluation.",

    "notes": "• Mixing dissociatives with alcohol, GHB/GBL, or opioids markedly increases risks of vomiting, loss of consciousness, and aspiration; if someone becomes unresponsive, place them in the recovery position and seek help. This advice is extrapolated from ketamine combo data and general CNS-depressant synergy.\n• Heavy/frequent ketamine use can cause lower urinary tract symptoms and ulcerative cystitis; HXE is an arylcyclohexylamine and may plausibly share this risk with chronic/high-frequency patterns even though direct human data for HXE are lacking—err on the side of caution and stop if urinary symptoms (urgency, pain, frequency, hematuria) emerge.\n• Coordination and balance can be profoundly impaired; do not drive or operate machinery and minimize fall hazards until fully baseline. NMDA-antagonist dissociation commonly causes ataxia and memory gaps.\n• Intranasal HXE is frequently described as harsh/inefficient due to poor water solubility; many report better effect per mg from oral dosing. Consider avoiding intranasal if you experience strong irritation. This is based on multiple community reports.\n• Urine immunoassay cross-reactions: PCP test false-positives are well-documented with dextromethorphan and tramadol; there is no strong evidence ketamine/HXE themselves trigger PCP positives. Confirm unexpected screens with GC/MS.\n• Ketamine elevates BP/HR in many users; dissociatives should be avoided if you have uncontrolled hypertension or significant cardiovascular disease. Apply similar caution to HXE.\n• Mislabeling is possible in the gray-market RC supply. Use reagent tests as a first pass and, where available, submit to a local drug checking service for GC/MS confirmation. Expect variability between batches.\n• Primary acute risks are sedation with emesis, ataxia, amnesia, and disorientation; ensure a calm, seated environment, avoid combining sedatives, and have a sober sitter when trialing new batches or doses.\n• Tolerance can build rapidly with repeated dosing over days; spacing sessions by multiple weeks reduces cumulative bladder, cognitive, and tolerance risks. Cross-tolerance to other arylcyclohexylamines is common. Evidence is mixed and largely anecdotal but consistent with ketamine experience. ",

Community users commonly report 4–8 mg PO 30–60 min before psychedelics to reduce body‑load nausea; evidence base is anecdotal rather than clinical trials.\n• QTc prolongation is dose‑ and infusion‑rate‑related; the 32 mg IV single dose was withdrawn and single IV doses >16 mg are not recommended. Faster than 15‑minute infusions increase QTc change. Avoid co‑administration with other QT‑prolonging drugs or in patients with congenital long QT, significant bradycardia, or uncorrected hypokalemia/magnesemia.\n• Absolute contraindication with apomorphine due to risk of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness.\n• “Serotonin syndrome” concern with 5‑HT3 antagonists is debated; mechanistically they do not increase synaptic serotonin and do not activate 5‑HT2A. Formal texts still warn when combined with serotonergic drugs, but toxicology/psychiatry clinicians often consider the risk negligible in routine 4–8 mg dosing. If used alongside strong releasers (MDMA) or DXM, monitor and keep doses conservative; discontinue and seek care if neuromuscular hyperactivity, hyperthermia, or altered mental status appear. (Mechanistic caution + expert commentary + anecdotal reports).\n• Headache and constipation are the most frequent side effects; constipation can be mitigated with fluids, fiber, and limiting repeated dosing. Seek urgent care for chest pain, syncope, palpitations, or severe dizziness (possible arrhythmia).\n• In hepatic impairment and in older adults, elimination is slower; use the lowest effective dose and avoid repeated high dosing. Oral dosing is typically preferred outside monitored settings; IV pushes should be avoided in favor of slow infusion when clinically indicated. (Label‑based pharmacokinetic principle; general HR guidance.)\n• During lactation, short‑term 4–8 mg dosing transfers minimally into milk and has not been associated with infant adverse effects in small studies; no special precautions are generally required.

    "notes": "Moclobemide is a selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitor used as an antidepressant; compared with irreversible MAOIs, it has a low propensity to trigger the classic ‘cheese reaction’ at therapeutic doses, but tyramine sensitivity can increase as doses approach or exceed 900 mg/day. Eating tyramine with a normal meal markedly blunts the pressor response compared with taking tyramine on an empty stomach; under typical therapeutic dosing (e.g., 100 mg TID), only mild potentiation of tyramine’s pressor effect was seen in volunteers. Despite the lower dietary risk, combining moclobemide with serotonergic drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs with serotonergic activity, MDMA, dextromethorphan, tramadol, meperidine, methadone) can precipitate serotonin toxicity and should be avoided. Co-administration with linezolid or methylene blue (both MAO-A inhibitors) is a recognized cause of serotonin toxicity; avoid unless essential and closely monitored. Stimulants and sympathomimetics (including pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine) are contraindicated with MAOIs because of hypertensive crises; this general MAOI rule applies to moclobemide as well. Triptans metabolized by MAO-A (e.g., rizatriptan; also zolmitriptan) show large exposure increases with moclobemide and are best avoided or dose-restricted under specialist supervision. Switching off moclobemide can generally be done faster than with irreversible MAOIs (short plasma half-life supports switching within roughly 24 hours), but clinicians may still use longer washouts depending on the target drug and patient risk. Pharmacokinetically, Tmax is about 0.3–1 h and the terminal half-life around 1–2 h (prolonged in hepatic impairment to ~4 h); moclobemide is mainly metabolized hepatically (not renally) with CYP2C19 involvement and inhibitory effects on CYP1A2/2C19/2D6. In overdose, moclobemide alone tends to be benign, but the combination with serotonergic agents (even at therapeutic doses) can produce severe serotonin toxicity requiring ICU-level care. Common adverse effects include dizziness, nausea, and insomnia; dose timing earlier in the day may mitigate insomnia. MAOIs can reduce alcohol tolerance and add CNS effects; avoid heavy drinking while treated. ",

    "notes": "- Identity: 3-CPM is a phenylmorpholine stimulant closely related to phenmetrazine and 3‑FPM; it has no established human pharmacokinetics, so interindividual variability and supply purity are major risks. Use small allergy tests and a calibrated milligram scale.\n- Potency/compulsion: Users frequently report a strong urge to redose, especially via intranasal or vaporized routes. Planning dose limits and spacing sessions reduces binge risk and residual insomnia.\n- Cardiovascular strain: Like other stimulants, it can raise heart rate and blood pressure and cause vasoconstriction; people with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or risk factors should avoid it. Seek medical care for chest pain, severe headache, or persistent tachycardia.\n- Nasal harm: Intranasal use is often described as extremely caustic with burning pain lasting 20–40 minutes; repeated lines increase epistaxis and septal damage risk. If choosing to snort, finely pulverize, use personal sterile straws, pre/post-rinse with isotonic saline, rotate nostrils, and take long breaks.\n- Pulmonary irritation: Vaporizing/smoking has been reported to cause harsh throat/lung irritation; unknown pyrolysis products may add risk. Avoid high-temperature hits and large boluses; oral ROA is safer for tissues.\n- Sleep/comedown: Residual stimulation commonly impairs sleep. Avoid late-day dosing; plan 24 h of recovery time, nutrition, and sleep hygiene.\n- Hydration/temperature: Stimulants increase core temperature and sweat. Sip ~250 mL water/hour at rest (up to 500 mL/hour if active) with electrolytes; take cooling breaks, and avoid hot environments.\n- Serotonergic combinations: Combining with MDMA, tramadol, or serotonergic antidepressants increases serotonin-toxicity risk (agitation, clonus, hyperthermia); avoid.\n- Seizure threshold: Tramadol and stimulant co-use raises seizure risk; avoid this combination.\n- Testing/purity: Reagents may not distinguish phenylmorpholine analogs; where available, use lab-based drug checking or spectrometric services. Avoid unknown vendors.\n- Drug testing: Phenmetrazine analogs may trigger amphetamine-class immunoassay positives; confirmatory testing distinguishes them but is not routine.\n- Storage: Keep powders in airtight, dry, dark containers; minimize oxygen and heat exposure. Let sealed containers warm to room temperature before opening to prevent condensation.",

    "notes": "First popular in Dutch party scenes (circa 2010); several serious hypertensive/cerebrovascular complications have been described in clinical series. Severe or unusual headache during or after use is a red-flag for possible hypertensive crisis or intracranial hemorrhage—stop all activity, avoid further dosing, and seek urgent medical assessment. Oral onset can be delayed 30–90 minutes; because the elimination half-life averages about 8–9 hours, redosing stacks plasma levels and markedly increases blood pressure risk—wait at least 2 hours before considering any additional dose, and avoid multiple redoses. Compared with MDMA or amphetamine intoxications, 4‑FA mono-intoxications present more often with severe headache and higher systolic BP in ED data; rare cases include Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Avoid mixing with serotonergic agents (SSRIs/SNRIs, MAOIs, MDMA, certain tryptamines) due to serotonin syndrome risk. Maintain moderate hydration and temperature control (especially in hot venues); both dehydration and overhydration are dangerous—sip small amounts of water regularly and take cool-down breaks. Insufflation is notably irritating to nasal mucosa; oral dosing is generally less caustic. Drug checking has found mis-selling (e.g., 4F‑MPH sold as 4‑FA); reagent testing or professional drug checking is strongly recommended and one should always start low and wait long enough to assess effects. Long-term neurotoxicity data are limited; until more is known, space sessions by several weeks, keep doses moderate, and avoid consecutive-day use.",

Avoid mixing with anesthesia/sedatives without medical oversight.\n• Anecdotes conflict on MAOI combinations; because bromantane increases dopaminergic tone, combining with MAOIs may unpredictably elevate catecholamines—treat as a do‑not‑mix unless a specialist is supervising.\n• Product quality varies across vendors (different odors, inactive lots reported); pharmaceutical‑grade sources are rare outside Russia. Use caution, seek third‑party analysis when possible, and be skeptical of sudden formulation changes.\n• Lipophilicity likely favors administration with dietary fat or oil for steadier effects; dry sublingual use is often reported as inconsistent.\n• High single doses can become paradoxically flattening or fatiguing for some; titrate slowly and stop if you develop apathy or headache.\n• People with bipolar spectrum, psychosis history, uncontrolled hypertension, significant liver disease, or pregnancy/breastfeeding should avoid non‑medical use due to unknowns and potential risk amplification.",

    "notes": "• Oral 2C‑D typically lasts 3.5–5 hours with a 15–45 minute onset; avoid redosing during the first 90 minutes because the come‑up can be deceptively light and the dose–response becomes steep, increasing risks of anxiety, hypertension, and confusion. Erowid timing table supports these ranges. • Use a milligram‑precision scale or volumetric dosing; this drug is active at low tens of milligrams and small measurement errors can radically increase intensity. Erowid’s general dosing guidance recommends threshold/allergy tests before a full trial. • Insufflation of 2C‑x compounds is often extremely painful and damaging to nasal mucosa and produces a sharper, less controllable onset; many users regret it even at low doses. Reports for 2C‑D note nasal irritation/drip and 2C‑T‑7/2C‑B pages document severe burning; oral dosing is generally safer on the body. • Combining with MAOIs (including linezolid) can unpredictably potentiate phenethylamines and raise the risk of serotonin toxicity or hypertensive crisis; avoid this combination entirely. • Lithium has repeatedly been linked to seizures and severe adverse reactions with serotonergic psychedelics (documented with LSD); by mechanism and class, this risk likely generalizes to 2C‑x, so avoid lithium + 2C‑D. • Tramadol lowers seizure threshold and adds serotonergic load; TripSit flags tramadol + 2C‑x as unsafe. • MDMA and other stimulants add cardiovascular and serotonergic stress; users report uncomfortable vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and anxiety when mixing stimulants with 2C‑x; avoid or approach only with strong precautions. • SSRIs/SNRIs commonly blunt classic psychedelic effects; they are not protective against adverse psychological reactions and can still interact in complex ways. If on prescription psych meds, do not stop them abruptly to ‘trip harder’; consult a clinician. • Expect mild elevation in heart rate and stimulation; those with uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, or significant cardiovascular disease should avoid use. • 2C‑D has been explored at low sub‑psychedelic doses for focus or “pharmacological tofu” potentiation; however, co‑administration with other psychedelics can extend or intensify effects unpredictably—treat combinations as higher risk and lower your doses if mixing. • Supply risks: Samples sold as “2C‑x” or “tusi/pink cocaine” are frequently polysubstance mixtures (ketamine/MDMA/cocaine etc.) and sometimes contain potent adulterants; use reagent or, ideally, lab drug checking before ingestion. • An initial allergy test at ~¼ of a light dose on a quiet day reduces idiosyncratic reaction risk; escalation should wait until full baseline the next session.

    "notes": "Name hygiene: no credible primary sources link PRE-084 to the alias “Fenclimorate”; retaining that name risks misidentification during procurement or verification. PubChem lists PRE-084 under the cyclohexanecarboxylate/morpholine ester names noted above. PRE-084 is a selective σ1 receptor agonist used as a research ligand; rodent work shows rapid CNS penetration and a plasma half-life near 3.3 h, but human pharmacokinetics remain unknown. σ1 receptor agonism modulates monoaminergic and glutamatergic signaling and can change the behavioural/toxic profile of stimulants; σ1 antagonists (BD1018/BD1063) attenuate several cocaine effects in mice, implying that σ1 agonists could do the opposite. Several SSRIs interact with σ1 (fluvoxamine/fluoxetine/escitalopram as agonists; sertraline with antagonist/inverse agonist properties), making co-use effects unpredictable. Dextromethorphan is itself a σ1 agonist and can interact at σ1 in animal models; combining high-dose DXM with PRE-084 may magnify or alter effects in either direction. Sparse human reports suggest mild mental stimulation, clarity, and occasionally insomnia; schedule daytime trials and avoid late dosing. Because identity/purity vary by vendor, weigh doses on a 0.001 g scale, and adjust for salt form (HCl ≈10–12% heavier than freebase for equivalent molar dose). Avoid inhalation/vaping routes—thermal decomposition profile is unknown for this ester; insufflation can be irritating and may increase bioavailability unpredictably. People with a history of seizures should avoid σ1 agonist stacks; some σ1-active agents (e.g., opipramol) showed proconvulsant effects in a PTZ-kindling mouse model. As a research chemical without established therapeutic window in humans, employ allergy test dosing (e.g., ≤1 mg) and increase only after ≥24 h with no adverse effects. Polysubstance ‘potentiation’ experiments (e.g., with psychedelics or dissociatives) carry poorly characterized risks due to σ1’s broad cellular roles—avoid until single-agent response is well understood.",

    "notes": "4‑Fluorodeprenyl is presumed to act as an irreversible, selective MAO‑B inhibitor at low doses by close analogy to selegiline; selectivity can diminish at higher doses, increasing tyramine sensitivity and hypertensive risk. Evidence from selegiline shows loss of strict MAO‑B selectivity with dose escalation and standard 14‑day washouts when switching to serotonergic agents; similar caution is prudent here. The functional duration of MAO‑B inhibition (24–48 h) outlasts the subjective stimulation, so redosing within this window can stack enzyme inhibition and unpredictably amplify interactions. Selegiline is metabolized via CYP2B6 (major) and CYP3A4/2A6 (minor) to active amphetamine/methamphetamine metabolites; 4‑fluorodeprenyl likely follows a similar CYP pattern, so strong inducers/inhibitors may alter exposure. By structure analogy to selegiline, para‑fluoro substitution implies possible formation of 4‑fluoromethamphetamine and 4‑fluoroamphetamine as metabolites; this is plausible but not directly confirmed in humans—treat as a risk that could add serotonergic/stimulant load. Avoid combining with serotonergic drugs (SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs/MDMA/DXM/tramadol) or certain antibiotics (linezolid) and dyes (methylene blue) due to serotonin‑toxicity risk established for MAO inhibitors. At higher doses, counsel on tyramine control (aged cheeses, cured meats, soy products, certain beers/wines) because irreversible MAO inhibition can precipitate hypertensive crises, especially as MAO‑A inhibition emerges. Monitor for insomnia, anxiety, headache, orthostatic hypotension, and BP elevation; these are documented with selegiline and are possible here. If used more than once weekly, consider spacing doses by at least 48 h (preferably longer) to avoid accumulation of irreversible MAO‑B inhibition. Because RC markets are error‑prone, get samples analyzed by a trusted drug‑checking service; mislabeling and batch variability are common, and ‘lab screenshots’ from sellers can be misleading or outdated. If switching to or from serotonergic prescription meds, use conservative washouts (often 14 days for irreversible MAOIs) unless a clinician directs otherwise.",

    "notes": "Low oral bioavailability (~21%) and a delayed peak (~1.6–1.8 h) increase the risk of impatient redosing; wait at least 2 hours to assess effects before taking more. The parent drug and its metabolites (notably dihydromorphine and DHC‑6‑glucuronide) mediate effects; CYP2D6 O‑demethylation is polymorphic and inhibited by some medications, so potency can vary widely between people and with drug–drug interactions. Most non‑medical harms come from polydrug use: combining opioids with benzodiazepines and/or alcohol markedly elevates overdose risk via additive respiratory depression. Many DHC products are combined with acetaminophen; do not exceed 4,000 mg acetaminophen in 24 h from all sources to avoid potentially fatal hepatotoxicity (reduce to ≤3,000 mg/day if risk factors exist). Avoid crushing/chewing controlled‑release tablets; as with other extended‑release opioids, tampering can cause dose dumping and life‑threatening overdose. Carry naloxone if using opioids; it reverses respiratory depression within minutes but may wear off in 20–40 minutes—always call emergency services. Nasal use of tablets exposes sinuses to insoluble binders and offers little benefit; prefer oral use of known single‑ingredient products. Tolerance builds quickly; after even short breaks, tolerance drops and the prior ‘usual’ dose may cause overdose—start low again. Opioids predictably cause constipation; start prevention early (fluids, fiber, movement; consider stimulant or osmotic laxatives if needed). Avoid driving or operating machinery while sedated; opioid effects can outlast the perceived ‘high,’ and some services recommend at least 24 hours before driving after recreational use.",

Use only where advanced airway management and continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring are available.\n• Thiopental produces hypnosis without analgesia and can be anti‑analgesic at small doses, so it should never be relied upon for pain control; painful stimuli may provoke sympathetic responses unless adequate analgesia is provided by other agents.\n• Effects after a single bolus end primarily via rapid redistribution from brain to muscle/fat; repeated boluses or infusions saturate peripheral compartments, leading to accumulation, prolonged sedation, and delayed respiratory depression.\n• Extravasation risk: thiopental is a vesicant; infiltration can cause severe tissue necrosis. If infiltration is suspected, stop administration and follow institutional extravasation protocols (specialist management may include hyaluronidase or phentolamine). Avoid small/fragile veins.\n• Histamine release (notable with thiopental and thiamylal) can precipitate hypotension and bronchospasm; exercise caution in reactive airway disease, hypovolemia, or hemodynamic instability.\n• Absolute/major contraindications for barbiturates include acute intermittent/variegate porphyria, where barbiturates induce ALA‑synthase and can trigger life‑threatening attacks.\n• Pregnancy/obstetrics: thiopental crosses the placenta within about 1 minute and can cause neonatal respiratory depression when used near delivery; if used, neonatal resuscitation capability is required.\n• Lactation: after a single anesthetic dose, clinically significant exposure via breast milk is low; routine breastfeeding can usually resume when the mother is awake, alert, and neurologically recovered, per anesthetic lactation resources. Individualize based on procedure and co‑medications.\n• Renal disease is a relative contraindication for thiopental; avoid or use extreme caution due to altered distribution/clearance. Hepatic impairment also increases risk because barbiturates undergo hepatic metabolism. Dose requirements are reduced in older adults.\n• Because dosing is weight‑based (commonly ~3–5 mg/kg IV for induction) and cardiorespiratory depression is dose‑dependent, fixed‑milligram self‑administration is unsafe; any use must be by trained clinicians with airway equipment immediately available.\n• Do not drive or operate machinery for the remainder of the day after exposure; psychomotor impairment can persist for hours, longer if multiple doses or other depressants are involved.

Mislabeling is common in this class—use drug checking and perform an allergy test before any psychoactive dose. Community reports describe a short‑to‑moderate duration dissociative with heavy body load, motor incoordination, and intermittent euphoria; sensitivity varies widely, so start low and wait a full onset window (at least 60–120 minutes oral, 45–60 minutes IN) before considering any redose. Dissociatives can aggravate lower urinary tract symptoms; ketamine‑like urological complications (including cystitis) are dose/frequency‑related—prioritize spacing (≥2–4 weeks), hydration, and early cessation if urinary discomfort, urgency, or pain occurs. Combining dissociatives with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, GHB/GBL) markedly increases risks of blackout, aspiration, and accidents; stimulants raise cardiovascular strain and can precipitate agitation or manic states; avoid tramadol due to seizure risk and serotonergic complications. Use precise measurement: 0.001 g scales and volumetric dosing reduce dosing error and support allergy testing (e.g., ≤1 mg) when a lab result is unavailable. Expect impaired coordination and lingering fog; do not drive or perform safety‑critical tasks until fully baseline the next day. Market reports have noted bladder irritation and supply confusion (e.g., O‑PCE or O‑PCP sold instead); reagent tests are insufficient—seek lab‑based drug checking where available.",

Oral ingestion has been inferred around 60–90 minutes before collapse in at least one case. • PK in humans is not characterized; forensic authors explicitly note that no formal ADME data are available. Effects often outlast expected elimination due to redosing and sleep loss. • Vaporizing freebase produces an almost instantaneous rush, very short peak, and intense craving to redose every minutes; multi‑hour binges with psychosis and severe sleep deprivation are repeatedly reported. • Oral dosing is generally the least compulsive; spacing redoses by several hours markedly reduces adverse effects and next‑day insomnia. • Prominent adverse effects include tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction with cold extremities, jaw tension, sweating, anxiety/paranoia, and insomnia; high doses and sleep deprivation increase risk of stimulant psychosis. • Non‑selective beta‑blockers can theoretically worsen stimulant‑induced vasoconstriction; for agitation/overstimulation, first‑line harm‑reduction is rest in a cool environment and anxiolytics (e.g., prescribed benzodiazepines) rather than self‑medicating with beta‑blockers. • Avoid combinations that lower seizure threshold (e.g., tramadol, high‑dose bupropion). • Mislabeling within the cathinone market is common (e.g., α‑PVP/MDPPP sold as 3‑MMC); reagent/drug‑checking is advised and test a tiny dose first even if it looks familiar. • Freebase/smoking leaves a persistent amine‑like odor that can cling to hair/clothes and indoor spaces; ensure ventilation and consider routes that reduce neighborhood exposure and binge risk. • For nasal use, crush finely, use personal equipment, pre/post saline, and rotate nostrils to reduce tissue injury. • Maintain hydration and electrolytes, avoid overheating and prolonged exertion, and protect sleep; many severe reactions follow continuous wakefulness rather than a single dose.",

Avoid driving or operating hazardous machinery for a minimum of 4–6 hours after inhalation and longer after higher oral doses; co‑use with alcohol markedly magnifies crash risk. THC can remain detectable long after impairment has resolved, especially in frequent users.\n• Inhaled vapes: Avoid illicit/counterfeit THC cartridges; vitamin E acetate and other diluents were strongly linked to EVALI cases in 2019. Prefer regulated, tested products if vaping at all.\n• Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS): Chronic, heavy use can cause cyclic vomiting relieved by hot showers; topical capsaicin may help acutely, but complete cessation is the definitive treatment.\n• Cardiovascular and orthostatic effects: THC can cause tachycardia and vasodilation with orthostatic hypotension; people with significant cardiovascular disease should avoid or minimize THC.\n• Mental health: Higher‑THC exposure, early onset, and heavy/frequent use are associated with increased risk of anxiety symptoms and psychotic‑like experiences; avoid if you have a personal or strong family history of psychosis, and prefer lower‑THC/higher‑CBD products if using.\n• Adolescents/young adults: Because brains are still developing, initiate use later if at all; frequent adolescent use is linked to worse mental‑health and cognitive outcomes.\n• Pregnancy and lactation: Avoid cannabis/CBD during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. THC crosses the placenta and is excreted into breast milk for days to weeks; potential neurodevelopmental risks are uncertain but concerning.\n• Storage and pediatric safety: Edibles are a common source of accidental pediatric intoxication; store products in child‑resistant containers, locked and out of sight.\n• Product variability: Non‑prescription CBD products and some cannabis edibles can be mislabeled for potency and purity; use lab‑tested, regulated sources when possible.\n• Tolerance: With frequent use, CB1 down‑regulation produces tolerance to many subjective effects; tolerance reverses over days to weeks of abstinence, which also reduces withdrawal symptoms (sleep disturbance, irritability, appetite change).\n• Genetics/phenoconversion: CYP2C9 poor metabolizers, or those taking CYP2C9 inhibitors, may experience stronger/longer effects from oral THC; start with lower doses.

    },
    "notes": "Reasoning for key harm-reduction updates: 1) Modern “Captagon” tablets are almost universally amphetamine-based counterfeits, not fenethylline. Multiple EMCDDA/EUDA reports show EU-seized tablets typically contain amphetamine (often with caffeine) and no fenethylline; some analyses estimate ≈32 mg amphetamine sulfate per tablet. This means dose/effect expectations for genuine fenethylline do not apply to street tablets; accurate identification requires instrumental analysis (e.g., GC/MS or LC-MS). 2) Fenethylline is a codrug cleaved to amphetamine and theophylline in vivo; the methylxanthine fraction contributes adenosine antagonism and PDE inhibition, raising heart rate and excitability and—at higher exposures—seizure risk. Thus, avoiding extra caffeine and being alert to theophylline-like toxicity (nausea, tremor, tachyarrhythmia) is prudent. 3) Stimulants combined with MAOIs can precipitate hypertensive crisis; standard references list amphetamine as contraindicated within 14 days of MAOI therapy. Treat fenethylline with the same caution because its active stimulant metabolite is amphetamine. 4) Mixing with serotonergic antidepressants and CYP2D6 inhibitors increases serotonin-syndrome risk for amphetamine; monitor closely or avoid. 5) Theophylline is metabolized mainly by CYP1A2; inhibitors can raise levels and toxicity. This underpins caution with drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 and with heavy caffeine co-use. 6) Urinary pH strongly modulates amphetamine elimination; alkalinization prolongs effects/toxicity, while acidification increases clearance. Users should avoid deliberate alkalinization when concerned about over-stimulation. 7) Environment/heat: stimulants elevate body temperature; hot indoor/outdoor settings increase the risk of hyperthermia and organ damage—plan cooling breaks and hydration with electrolytes. 8) General stimulant harm reduction advises avoiding polystimulant stacks and using test services where possible; EUDA notes that reagents are insufficient to verify fenethylline—instrumental drug checking is needed. 9) Cardiovascular screening: amphetamine-class agents are contraindicated in significant cardiovascular disease/hyperthyroidism/glaucoma; treat fenethylline similarly due to its active amphetamine metabolite and theophylline side-effects. 10) Legal status: fenethylline is internationally controlled (e.g., US Schedule I; UN Psychotropics Schedule II); possession/supply penalties may be severe.

    },
    "notes": "• Methadone has wide interindividual half-life variability; steady state occurs after several half-lives and can take about 5 days on average, but after a dose change complete equilibration may take up to ~12 days. This creates a high risk of unintentional accumulation and delayed respiratory depression during the first 3–7+ days of induction or after dose increases; dose cautiously and avoid stacking.\n• Peak serum levels occur ~2–4 hours after an oral dose; clinical effects last much longer than most full-agonist opioids due to tissue redistribution and slow elimination. First doses may feel shorter (~8 h), with subsequent daily doses often covering 18–24 h as tissues saturate.\n• Methadone can prolong the QTc interval and, rarely, trigger torsades de pointes. Risk rises with higher doses, drug interactions, electrolyte abnormalities, or baseline cardiac disease. Consider ECG monitoring in patients with risk factors or when escalating to higher doses; alternative OAT (e.g., buprenorphine) shows less QTc effect.\n• CYP interactions are clinically significant. Enzyme inducers (rifampin; certain anticonvulsants) can precipitate withdrawal; inhibitors (azoles, macrolides; some SSRIs; grapefruit) can increase methadone exposure and sedation/QT risk. Review new meds and adjust methadone carefully.\n• Combining methadone with benzodiazepines, alcohol, gabapentinoids, or other depressants markedly increases overdose risk; co-prescriptions of opioids with these agents are associated with higher overdose rates. Avoid or minimize these combinations; if unavoidable, use the lowest effective doses and add naloxone.\n• Methadone has modest serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibition; combining with serotonergic drugs (SSRIs/SNRIs, MAOIs, linezolid, tramadol, etc.) can precipitate serotonin syndrome—use caution and monitor.\n• In overdose reversal, naloxone’s action is shorter than methadone’s; renarcotization is common. Observe for at least 6–12 hours and consider naloxone infusion when large or long‑acting opioid exposures (e.g., methadone) are suspected.\n• Analgesic duration is shorter than elimination half-life; residual sedation and psychomotor impairment can outlast analgesia by many hours—avoid driving or hazardous tasks until fully alert.\n• Missing several consecutive doses lowers tolerance; resuming the prior dose can cause overdose. After ≥3–4 missed doses, reduce and re‑titrate (e.g., 25–50% reduction) per guidelines.\n• Pregnancy: Methadone is standard care for OUD in pregnancy, but neonatal abstinence syndrome is expected; dose adjustments may be needed and drug–drug interactions are important.\n• Injection-specific risks: Injecting non‑parenteral methadone formulations increases risk of vein/tissue damage and infections due to excipients and non‑sterile technique. If a person injects any opioid, harm‑reduction advice includes sterile equipment/water and filtration.\n• Brand and international names vary (e.g., Dolophine, Methadose, Physeptone); liquid formulations may contain sugars, dyes, or alcohol—relevant to allergies, diabetes, and choosing sugar‑free options.

A 2025 systematic review of deliberate self‑poisoning cases found only case reports/series with heterogeneous regimens and no established efficacy; supportive care and benzodiazepines remain first-line. Do not self‑treat suspected serotonin syndrome—seek emergency care.\n- If a clinician elects to use cyproheptadine for serotonin toxicity, commonly referenced toxicology regimens use an oral loading dose (e.g., 12 mg) followed by small repeat doses (e.g., 2 mg every 2 h) to clinical response, with typical daily maxima around 32 mg; however, this is based on low‑quality evidence and expert opinion. Only oral forms exist; tablets can be crushed for NG administration in hospital. This should not be improvised outside medical settings.\n- Sedation and psychomotor impairment are prominent; Tmax after oral dosing is ~4 h, so peak impairment can lag the dose. Avoid driving, cycling, operating machinery, climbing, or swimming for the rest of the day and potentially into the following morning after ≥8 mg.\n- Anticholinergic adverse effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, confusion) are common; risks are higher in older adults, in heat, with dehydration, and when combined with other anticholinergics. Angle‑closure glaucoma and symptomatic BPH are classical cautions.\n- Rare but documented idiosyncratic cholestatic/mixed hepatotoxicity has occurred within 1–6 weeks of initiation (LiverTox likelihood score C). For multi‑week courses, consider baseline and symptom‑triggered LFT checks; discontinue if jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, or RUQ pain emerge.\n- Paradoxical CNS stimulation can occur in pediatrics; outside clinician‑directed use (e.g., appetite stimulation), avoid non‑medical pediatric exposure.\n- Using cyproheptadine to pre‑ or co‑load with MDMA/psychedelics will attenuate desired effects via 5‑HT2A antagonism; this can prompt risk‑enhancing redosing or polydrug use to “break through.” Safer practice is to avoid mixing and reserve cyproheptadine for clinician‑directed indications.\n- If serotonin toxicity is suspected (e.g., after combining SSRIs/SNRIs/tramadol/DXM/MAOIs with MDMA or other serotonergics), the correct action is immediate cessation, cooling, and emergency evaluation; cyproheptadine at home may mask features while the causative drug remains active.

Extremely short plasma half-life produces a sharp rush but also a steep post-peak crash. Naloxone fully reverses effects. Ethanol slows 6-MAM → morphine conversion, compounding respiratory depression. Modern drug checking programmes repeatedly find high variability in heroin potency, occasional inclusion of other high-potency opioids, benzodiazepine-type drugs, and veterinary tranquilizers (e.g., xylazine); start with a very small dose, avoid polydrug use, and check samples where possible. Fentanyl/‘benzo-dope’/‘tranq-dope’ mixtures raise overdose risk and may require repeated naloxone while providing only partial benefit if non-opioids are present; continue rescue breaths and call emergency services immediately. Naloxone acts within minutes but typically lasts ~20–40 min—renarcotization can occur as morphine levels or other opioids outlast naloxone, so monitor continuously and re-dose if breathing slows. After any abstinence (detox, jail, illness), tolerance drops quickly and overdose risk is markedly higher on prior ‘usual’ doses—halve or more if returning to use, and ideally use with someone who can intervene. For injection: use sterile water, correct acidifiers only when needed (citric/ascorbic for base forms), and avoid vinegar/lemon to reduce infection risk; use clean equipment every time and seek local needle/syringe services for supplies and wound care. For smoking: use foil, test tiny amounts first, and avoid deep sedation alone. Fentanyl test strips can be useful where permitted, but follow instructions carefully—the method and dilution determine reliability.",

    "notes": "Identity: 4-CEC is the para‑chloro ethyl analogue of cathinone; PubChem lists it under the formula C11H14ClNO and records both free base and HCl salt entries, confirming common naming and salt forms. Adulteration/misrepresentation risk is high: Swiss drug checking reported 4‑CEC being sold as 3‑MMC in December 2024; lab results urged extra caution and adherence to safer‑use tips. Always test before use. Toxicity uncertainty: Very limited human data exist for 4‑CEC; harm‑reduction services note its close structural relation to 4‑CMC (clephedrone), which is suspected to be highly neurotoxic, so conservative dosing and infrequent use are prudent. This is an inference from structural similarity and public health warnings rather than a proven clinical fact. Route risks: Multiple user reports describe severe nasal irritation with 4‑CEC; avoid insufflation if possible. If used intranasally, use tiny lines, rotate nostrils, and rinse with sterile saline after. Inhalation/vaping cautions: Hydrohalide salts of phenethylamines (the class cathinones belong to) can thermally decompose when vaporized, potentially releasing irritant byproducts; if people still choose to vaporize, converting to the freebase is commonly discussed in HR literature, but this carries extra chemistry risks. Safer approach is to avoid vaping unknown salts. Heat, dehydration, and overhydration: As with other stimulants, monitor temperature, take cooling breaks, and follow sensible fluid guidance (roughly 250 mL/hour at rest, up to 500 mL/hour if dancing), as recommended by harm‑reduction groups for cathinones. Testing: Reagent tests cannot prove purity but can help differentiate MDMA from many cathinones; using a panel (Marquis, Froehde, Simon’s, Zimmermann, Morris) improves discrimination within cathinones. Whenever available, seek lab‑grade drug checking. Market context: EMCDDA (EUDA) notes cathinones are frequently mis‑sold as MDMA or other stimulants and appear in powder/tablet forms; treat unknown powders cautiously and avoid polydrug use. Compulsive redosing: Some users report strong urge to redose and extended sessions with chlorinated cathinones; prioritize pre‑measured doses and time limits to curb binges. This is based on anecdotal reports rather than formal dependence data. Post‑use low mood and sleep disruption are commonly reported across cathinones; plan recovery time (nutrition, sleep, hydration) and avoid frequent use. ",

Expect sustained stimulation and possible vasoconstriction (cold or tingly extremities); avoid additional vasoconstrictors and take gentle movement breaks to promote circulation. Oral administration is preferred over insufflation to reduce nasal harm and erratic absorption. Because of long duration and residual alertness, avoid late‑day dosing and plan for sleep disruption; do not counteract with large amounts of alcohol or multiple sedatives. People with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or arrhythmia should avoid use; monitor pulse and temperature in physically demanding settings. Use lab drug checking where available or at minimum multi‑reagent testing; the gray market has a history of mislabeling phenethylamines. Ensure accurate weighing (calibrated mg scale) and consider volumetric dilution for precise titration. Avoid driving or safety‑critical tasks for at least 16–24 hours after dosing.",

Reagent‑test every batch; 2C‑B look‑alikes (e.g., 25x‑NBOMe) and even dangerous stimulant + NBOMe mixtures have been sold as ‘2C‑B’, so treat any unlabeled powder or pill with caution and use multiple reagents. User timelines cluster around 50–65 mg oral for a moderate experience (~9 h), with 100–120 mg producing longer, stronger effects; several reports note migraine‑like headaches during the late comedown. Intranasal administration is widely reported as extremely painful (‘snorting glass’) with little to no efficacy advantage; prefer oral dosing. Because onset can be gradual and the experience long, avoid redosing during the first 3–4 h and space sessions by at least 2 weeks to limit tolerance and sleep disruption. General phenethylamine guidance applies: avoid combining with MAOIs and seizure‑threshold–lowering drugs (e.g., tramadol); keep hydration moderate with electrolytes if active; and prepare benzodiazepines only for emergency anxiety under sober supervision. Anecdotally, jaw clenching/bruxism occurs; some users find magnesium supplements helpful, but evidence is limited and dosing should stay within typical dietary ranges. Always measure with a 0.001 g scale (or carefully prepared volumetric dosing) and perform an allergy test on a tiny amount before a full dose.",

    "notes": "Melatonin is an endogenous hormone that acts primarily as a chronobiotic, signaling biological night via MT1/MT2 receptors; it is not a general sedative-hypnotic and works best when timing aligns with circadian goals. Immediate-release is usually better for sleep-onset issues, while modified/extended-release can help with sleep maintenance; using the wrong formulation can reduce benefit. For sleep-onset insomnia, many adults respond to 0.5–1 mg taken 30–60 minutes before the intended bedtime; escalating beyond 3–5 mg often adds next-morning grogginess or vivid dreams without improving sleep. For circadian phase shifting (e.g., jet lag or delayed sleep phase), earlier-evening dosing tends to advance sleep timing and late-night dosing can delay it; consistent timing night-to-night is more important than dose size. Alcohol and other CNS depressants increase impairment and can disrupt sleep architecture; avoid combining close to bedtime if possible. Quality control of over-the-counter melatonin products varies widely; independent analyses have found large deviations from labeled dose and occasional contamination (e.g., serotonin), so prefer reputable brands with third-party testing and start low. Fluvoxamine and other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors can greatly increase melatonin levels; conversely, cigarette smoking and high caffeine intake may reduce efficacy. Melatonin can lower blood pressure modestly; those on antihypertensive or anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy should monitor for dizziness or bruising/bleeding. Use caution in autoimmune conditions or with immunosuppressants due to melatonin’s immunomodulatory actions. Safety data in pregnancy and breastfeeding are limited; non-pharmacologic sleep measures are preferred and medical guidance is advised before use. As with any sleep aid, avoid driving or hazardous tasks for several hours after dosing and especially if feeling drowsy the next morning. If nightly use is ineffective after a week, reconsider timing, formulation, and sleep hygiene (dark environment, reduced evening light/screens) rather than increasing dose.",

    "notes": "4-MTA is a potent serotonin-releasing agent with additional MAO-A–inhibiting activity; this dual action is strongly linked to severe hyperthermia and serotonin toxicity seen in clusters of 1997–1999 European cases. The EU risk assessment emphasized a slow onset and long-lasting effects that promoted redosing and overdoses, especially when mis-sold as MDMA. Because 4-MTA can functionally inhibit MAO-A, combining it with serotonergic medications (SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs), other recreational serotonergics (MDMA, PMA/PMMA, DXM, tramadol), or tyramine-rich foods can precipitate dangerous hypertensive or serotonin syndromes. Historical harm data include multiple deaths; some were associated with pills sold as 'ecstasy' where users re-dosed due to delayed onset. Avoid all combinations and redosing; the safest choice is to not use at all. If someone has taken it, active cooling (shade, fans, loosening clothing), fluids with electrolytes, and rapid medical evaluation are critical at the first signs of serotonin toxicity (agitation, confusion, tremor/hyperreflexia, clonus, sweating, temperature rising). Do not rely on antipyretics alone and do not self-treat severe agitation with alcohol or polypharmacy. Expect effects to persist all day or longer; avoid any serotonergic agent for at least 24–48 hours after exposure due to lingering pharmacologic effects. Because 4-MTA has been misrepresented in tablets, reagent tests may not reliably identify it; if using any pressed pill or powder, drug-checking with laboratory-grade services is far safer than color reagents. Warm, crowded environments and prolonged dancing markedly increase hyperthermia risk; rest often, pre-plan cooling, and have a sober sitter who can call emergency services if symptoms escalate. Early hospital care saves lives; tell clinicians exactly what was taken to guide management (e.g., benzodiazepine sedation, aggressive cooling).",

Nitazenes (including protonitazene) are highly potent and have been increasingly detected in Europe and North America, often in counterfeit or mis-sold products (e.g., heroin lookalikes and fake oxycodone/benzodiazepine tablets). Fentanyl test strips do not detect nitazenes; do not rely on them to rule out nitazenes—use laboratory-grade drug checking where available. Due to potency, active at double-digit microgram doses with a steep dose–response; volumetric dosing and calibrated 0.1 mg (or better) scales are strongly advised. Overdose management: initial response is the same as for other opioids; multiple naloxone doses may be required for reversal with potent synthetic opioids; provide rescue breathing and seek emergency care. Nitazenes often co-occur with other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, xylazine); such combinations substantially increase overdose risk. Multiple naloxone administrations may be needed and monitoring after reversal is important because naloxone’s duration is shorter than many opioids. Powder and tablets containing nitazenes have been confirmed by drug checking services in fake oxycodone and other pills; assume unknowns contain high-potency opioids unless proven otherwise. Human pharmacokinetics for protonitazene remain poorly characterized; avoid redosing to ‘chase’ effects. Powder appearance or color is not a reliable indicator of content; only lab testing can confirm identity.",

Reagent-only testing can miss cathinone adulterants; use multiple reagents (e.g., Marquis, Froehde, Simon’s, Zimmermann, Morris) or a lab drug checking service. Start with very low single doses, wait for full onset (at least 2 hours oral), and avoid stacking to reduce overamping and insomnia. Strong stimulant effects can produce hyperthermia, tachycardia, agitation, anxiety or paranoia; overheating should be treated with active cooling and rest in a shaded/ventilated area. Hydrate with small, regular sips and electrolytes (rough guide: ~250 mL/h at rest; up to ~500 mL/h if dancing), avoiding overconsumption of water. Avoid combining with serotonergic medicines (MAOIs, high-dose SSRIs/SNRIs) or DXM/tramadol due to serotonin syndrome and seizure risk. Avoid other stimulants (including high caffeine) and synthetic cannabinoids due to unpredictable cardiovascular and mental effects. Intranasal use increases burn/vasoconstriction and compulsive redosing; space lines widely and rinse with saline after sessions. IV use is strongly discouraged: user reports indicate poor water solubility and precipitation on cooling, which raises embolic/infection risks; seek medical settings only if complications arise. If severe symptoms occur (chest pain, extreme agitation, core temp >39\u00181C, confusion, seizures), seek emergency care; do not self-treat with more substances.",

Intranasal administration is frequently described as extremely painful with notable mucosal irritation and offers little safety advantage over oral routes while increasing the risk of rapid-onset anxiety or dysphoria. Always test unknown powders or pressed tablets with multiple reagents and, where available, use laboratory drug checking; 2C‑x tablets and powders have been found with synth impurities or misidentified contents. NBOMe compounds can be sold or confused as 2C‑x; they are active at sub‑milligram doses and have caused severe vasoconstriction and seizures—do not assume blotters or unusually potent materials are 2C‑C. Mixing serotonergic psychedelics with lithium has repeatedly been linked to seizures and life‑threatening reactions; this warning generalizes beyond LSD to serotonergic compounds, and several 2C‑x + lithium cases exist—avoid entirely. MAOIs can unpredictably potentiate phenethylamines and are best avoided; tramadol lowers seizure threshold and is dangerous with psychedelics. Stimulant combinations (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine) raise cardiovascular strain and anxiety; avoid. SSRIs/SNRIs commonly blunt psychedelic effects and make dose predictability poor; use caution and do not compensate by redosing high. For accurate dosing, use a calibrated 0.001 g scale and consider volumetric dosing for low or highly sensitive ranges; cheap pocket scales are often inaccurate below ~10–20 mg. Cross‑tolerance with other classic psychedelics is expected; waiting at least a week (preferably 2) between sessions reduces tolerance and psychological hangover. Set, setting, and trip‑sitter/plan matter; avoid driving and high‑risk activities until fully baseline.",

    "notes": "Pharmacology is presumed similar to methaqualone: a quinazolinone that potentiates GABAA receptors via transmembrane sites, which explains sedation, motor impairment, and synergy with other depressants. This mechanism predicts additive respiratory depression when combined with alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or GHB/GBL—combinations strongly linked to fatal overdoses in the depressant class. Multiple user reports and forum moderator warnings describe prominent myoclonic jerks/twitching and, at higher doses or with redosing/mixes, seizures; this risk appears greater than with many prescribed hypnotics. Delayed onset (often 60–90 minutes) has led some to redose prematurely; stacking increases adverse effects and blackout risk. Several reports note that even small amounts of alcohol can abruptly potentiate effects; avoid any co-depressants. Insufflation is frequently described as caustic with unpredictable absorption and more abrupt adverse effects; oral use with accurately weighed doses is safer from a harm-reduction standpoint. Because this is an unregulated RC, potency and identity may vary by batch; reagent kits may not distinguish quinazolinones reliably, and only accredited drug checking (GC/MS, LC-MS) can confirm contents—these services also have detection limits and sampling caveats. If someone becomes unresponsive or severely sedated, keep the airway clear and use the recovery position while calling emergency services; do not give additional depressants. If seizures occur, do not place anything in the person’s mouth; seek emergency care—benzodiazepines are used in clinical settings by professionals, but unsupervised self-administration can worsen respiratory depression. Expect residual sedation and psychomotor impairment the next day; avoid driving or hazardous tasks until fully recovered. Frequent use can produce tolerance and withdrawal-like rebound (anxiety/insomnia), so leave multi-day gaps and avoid daily dosing. ",

Treat as a highly potent opioid with major respiratory‑depression risk. • Fentanyl test strips (FTS) do not detect benzimidazole/nitazene opioids; assume an FTS negative does not rule cychlorphine in/out. Lab‑based drug checking is required to identify these compounds. • In many cities, opioid powders and pressed pills frequently contain multiple high‑potency opioids and additional depressants (benzodiazepine‑related drugs, xylazine/medetomidine). This stacking markedly increases overdose risk even at ‘usual’ doses. • Carry take‑home naloxone; multiple doses may be needed for ultra‑potent opioids. Always call emergency services because sedation can outlast naloxone and non‑opioid adulterants (e.g., xylazine) will not be reversed by naloxone. • Avoid combining with any CNS depressant (alcohol, benzodiazepines, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, gabapentinoids); such combinations are repeatedly implicated in fatal respiratory depression. • Dose in solution (volumetric dosing) rather than weighing micrograms; use a known concentration and measure with a syringe. TripSit provides a volumetric converter to help avoid microgram dosing errors. • Start with the smallest possible dose, especially after any break; potency and duration vary and redosing during the first hour substantially increases overdose risk as the peak may be delayed. • Never use alone; have someone present with naloxone who can place you in recovery position and call for help if breathing slows. Recognize overdose signs: deep snoring/gurgling, blue lips, unresponsiveness, slow/absent breathing. • If injecting, use sterile equipment, filter solutions, and avoid rapid pushes; IV use has the narrowest margin of safety. Consider non‑injecting routes to reduce acute risk. (General HR consensus; see TripSit resources.) • Field reports suggest that benzimidazolone opioids may circulate under many names and be sold as ‘fentanyl’ or ‘oxy’ tablets; treat all unfamiliar powders/pills as possibly containing ultra‑potent opioids. • Because metabolism is unknown for cychlorphine, avoid strong CYP inhibitors/inducers and other PK‑interacting drugs; unexpected potentiation is possible.

    "notes": "• Identity and occurrence: 5‑Bromo‑DMT is a brominated DMT analogue occurring naturally in several marine sponges (e.g., Verongula rigida, Smenospongia aurea, S. cerebriformis). This supports that samples labeled 5‑Br‑DMT can be legitimate, but also that mislabeling is possible—so verify identity where possible.\n• Pharmacology and animal data: In rodent and chick models, 5,6‑dibromo‑DMT showed antidepressant‑like effects, while 5‑bromo‑DMT caused significant hypolocomotion (sedative‑like action). This aligns with user descriptions of a warm, dreamy, lightly visual profile rather than intense 5‑HT2A‑type psychedelia. Extrapolation to humans is uncertain, so cautious titration is warranted.\n• Freebase vs salt and ROA: Community reports consistently note that freebase 5‑Br‑DMT vaporizes effectively, whereas the fumarate/salt is poor to smoke and may need conversion to freebase for inhalation; this is typical of tryptamine salts. Avoid open flames and overheating to reduce harshness.\n• Avoid insufflation: Multiple reports describe severe burning and mucosal irritation from snorting dry powder; even at 60 mg the pain was extreme and benefits minimal. If someone insists on an intranasal route, buffered aqueous sprays have been used anecdotally to reduce burn, but effects remain mild and data limited.\n• Oral use appears weak/inactive without MAOI: Users report minimal effects at 60–120 mg orally. Combining with MAOIs to force oral activity is hazardous due to potentiation and serotonin‑toxicity risks; this route is not recommended.\n• Duration and profile: When vaporized, onset is within 1–2 minutes, the peak is short (≈3–20 min), and most are near baseline by 1–2 hours. Effects commonly include soft closed‑eye imagery, mild color/tracer enhancement, and relaxation/sleepiness rather than overwhelming open‑eye hallucinations.\n• Combinations and safety: General psychedelic combination guidance applies—avoid with tramadol (seizure risk), be cautious with stimulants/cannabis (unpredictable synergy), and avoid MAOIs unless under clinical supervision. Benzodiazepines can dampen or abort distress but add sedation.\n• Drug checking: Indoles/tryptamines react with Ehrlich reagent (purple). While this doesn’t prove identity, a negative Ehrlich raises suspicion for non‑indole adulterants. Use multi‑reagent kits and, where available, lab testing.\n• Set/setting and physical safety: Sedation and ataxia at higher doses are reported; use a sitter, remain seated during peaks, and avoid driving/heights. Given sparse human data, allergy test first (≤2 mg inhaled) and titrate.\n• Data scarcity: Human pharmacokinetics and long‑term safety are unknown; avoid frequent redosing and extended binges. Treat as a research chemical with conservative dosing and long intervals between trials.",

    "notes": "5-BPDi (Indanyl-α-PHP) is a hexanone pyrrolidinophenone first detected on the grey market circa mid-2010s; formal human pharmacology/toxicology is lacking. As with related pyrrolidinophenones (α-PVP/MDPV), strong dopaminergic/noradrenergic stimulation can cause marked tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety, bruxism, vasoconstriction (cold/numb extremities), and hypervigilance; plan a dose cap, avoid heat/exertion, and monitor pulse/BP if possible. Residual stimulation often outlasts euphoria—late redosing commonly leads to insomnia and paranoia; set a hard stop time and prepare sleep hygiene or non-alcoholic sedating measures (without mixing high doses of depressants). Avoid combining with other stimulants or MAOIs due to hypertensive crisis/arrhythmia risk; tramadol and bupropion increase seizure risk; decongestants increase vasoconstriction. Because cathinone powders are frequently mis-sold/adulterated, use lab drug checking where available or multiple reagents (Marquis, Froehde, Simon’s, Zimmermann, Morris) and start with a 0.5–1 mg allergy test; expect that names/labels may not match contents. Oral administration is safer than insufflation; if snorting, reduce tissue damage and infection risk by using sterile personal equipment, crushing finely, rinsing with sterile saline, and spacing lines. Maintain hydration with electrolytes (about 250 mL/h at rest up to ~500 mL/h if active) without overhydrating; eat before use and plan a recovery window with sleep. Avoid use if you have cardiovascular disease, severe anxiety/psychosis risk, or during pregnancy/breastfeeding. Seek urgent care for chest pain, severe headache, confusion, hyperthermia, seizures, or prolonged psychosis—these can reflect stimulant toxicity or excited delirium.",

Purity and identity should be verified where possible. Slow onset and long tail make premature redosing risky; tolerance can build intra‑session, leading to greater side‑effects with little added benefit. As a serotonergic releaser, it carries serotonin syndrome risk—especially with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol/meperidine, linezolid, and other SRAs. Hyperthermia is possible in warm, crowded settings; take cooling breaks, avoid vigorous exertion, and maintain light, spaced fluids. Conversely, overhydration can cause hyponatraemia; sip small amounts regularly and consider electrolytes rather than rapid overconsumption of water. GI side‑effects (nausea, cramping, diarrhoea) are common with serotonergic drugs given the high proportion of peripheral 5‑HT in the gut. Cardiovascular strain (tachycardia, sweating) and bruxism are frequently reported; avoid combining with other stimulants. Insufflation increases local irritation; avoid repeated lines. Intravenous use is strongly discouraged due to unknown solubility/excipients and lack of clinical formulation. Space sessions widely (several weeks) to reduce tolerance and mood after‑effects, by analogy to MDMA‑like agents. Use a thermometer if active for long periods; if overheating or severe agitation/confusion/tremor/clonus occur, seek medical help; benzodiazepines and external cooling are standard first‑aid while awaiting care.",

    "notes": "• Identity uncertainty is a major risk: multiple forum analyses from 2010–2013 allege that products sold as “5‑IAI” were often inactive or different stimulants; treat all samples as unknown until reagent‑tested and, where available, lab drug checking confirms identity. This directly affects dose, onset, and safety planning.\n• Mechanistically, 5‑IAI behaves as a serotonin>norepinephrine≈dopamine releasing agent and substituted for MDMA in rodent discrimination studies, implying entactogenic effects with stimulant load; human data remain anecdotal.\n• Animal work found markedly less serotonergic neurotoxicity than para‑iodoamphetamine at comparable high doses, yet small decreases in serotonergic markers occurred; avoid high/repeated dosing.\n• A modern review notes affinity at 5‑HT2B among other 5‑HT receptors; while functional agonism is not fully characterized, conservative spacing is advised (valvulopathy is a theoretical risk across 5‑HT2B‑active entactogens).\n• Expect typical releaser risks: hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hyponatremia with overhydration or MDMA‑style water‑loading; use small, regular sips (~250 ml/hour in heat) and avoid alcohol‑induced dehydration. (General HR extrapolated to serotonergic releasers.)\n• Bruxism, muscle tension, and insomnia are common; magnesium may help bruxism for some but evidence is mixed; non‑drug measures (jaw rests, gum, warm compress) are lower‑risk first‑line.\n• Redosing yields diminishing returns and disproportionate side effects; plan a single dose, avoid stacking, and do not chase effects with stimulants. (Pattern observed across community reports.)\n• Space sessions generously (≥4–6 weeks) to allow serotonergic recovery and reduce mood after‑effects; shorter intervals correlate with more severe comedowns across releasers. (Best‑practice HR extrapolation.)\n• If on any serotonergic prescription (SSRI/SNRI/MAOI/triptan), avoid entirely due to elevated serotonin syndrome risk highlighted in HR lists and combo charts.\n• Non‑selective beta‑blockers during acute stimulation may worsen vasoconstriction; if chest pain, severe headache, hyperthermia, or confusion occur, seek emergency care rather than self‑medicating.\n• Prefer oral titration over insufflation/rectal to reduce local harm and dose overshoot; nasal use commonly reports irritation without clear benefit.\n• Because formal human PK is lacking, treat timing and interactions as uncertain; build extra buffers before driving, sleeping, or combining with any other psychoactives.

    "notes": "Deschloroetizolam is a thienotriazolodiazepine closely related to etizolam; drug checking programs describe it as roughly half as strong per milligram and lasting up to about twice as long as etizolam, which increases next-day impairment risk; plan activities accordingly. Community and HR sources consistently flag benzodiazepines combined with alcohol, opioids, or GHB/GBL as dangerous due to additive/synergistic respiratory depression; avoid these combinations entirely and place any unresponsive person in the recovery position while seeking emergency help. Tramadol with benzodiazepines is particularly risky because it adds respiratory/CNS depression and has seizure potential; avoid this pairing. Etizolam (the parent compound) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; given close structural similarity, deschloroetizolam may be similarly affected—CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antifungals, macrolides, grapefruit) can raise levels and prolong effects; dose conservatively and avoid redosing if such inhibitors are on board. Potency is in the low-milligram range; use a calibrated 0.001 g scale or volumetric dosing and ensure complete dissolution—do not rely on cloudy suspensions as uneven distribution can cause accidental overdoses and blackouts. Illicit supply variability is high; drug checking services have repeatedly detected deschloroetizolam—sometimes unexpectedly—in fentanyl samples; if any opioid exposure is possible, keep naloxone available (it reverses opioids, not benzodiazepines) and avoid using alone. Regular use builds tolerance quickly and can produce significant dependence; abrupt cessation after sustained use can trigger severe withdrawal and seizures—seek medical supervision for any taper. Flumazenil can reverse benzodiazepine effects in medical settings but may precipitate seizures in benzodiazepine-dependent people or mixed overdoses; it must not be self-administered. Avoid driving or operating machinery for at least a full waking day after significant doses due to amnesia, impaired coordination, and residual sedation. Because formal human pharmacokinetic data are limited, all timelines should be treated as approximate; start low, wait full onset and peak, and avoid stacking doses.",

    "notes": "Reasoning for changes (key harm-reduction facts and sources): Nicotine dosing is highly route-dependent. Inhalation gives a near-immediate spike with short primary duration, while buccal products act slower/longer and patches provide stable, lower peaks—these differences influence overdose risk and redosing behavior. Erowid’s dosage page summarizes smoked, oral/buccal, intranasal ranges and typical patch delivery rates; the NCI PDQ shows marketed patch strengths and usage durations. These sources support the corrected/expanded ROA-specific dosing and time-course fields. Nicotine poisoning risk is significant with concentrated e-liquids and dermal/ocular exposure; national reviews document severe outcomes and rare fatalities, emphasizing glove use, child-resistant storage, and avoiding decanting into drink-like containers. Pure nicotine is not the primary driver of combustion-related disease; switching from smoking to nicotine-only products removes smoke toxicants and CYP1A2 induction, which can unexpectedly raise levels of caffeine, clozapine, olanzapine, and theophylline—so proactive dose/caffeine reductions and monitoring are important during transitions. Pregnancy/breastfeeding: guidance advises behavioral support first; if NRT is used, short-acting forms and daytime patch-only use (remove before bed) can reduce fetal exposure and vivid dreams; overall, NRT is considered far safer than continued smoking, but not risk-free. Timing buccal doses right after breastfeeding can reduce infant exposure. These points guide safer choices for pregnant or lactating people who cannot stop nicotine abruptly. Tobacco smoke (not pure nicotine) contains MAO-inhibiting beta-carbolines that enhance reinforcement; this clarifies that the MAOI warning relates mainly to smoke chemistry, while pharmaceutical MAOIs warrant caution because nicotine is a sympathomimetic. Pharmacokinetics: nicotine’s body half-life is about 2 hours (cotinine ~16–18 h, useful for testing), informing redose spacing and why cravings recur quickly with inhaled use. Practical HR tips embedded above: start low and titrate slowly; avoid stacking different nicotine products simultaneously without a plan; keep liquids locked away from children/pets; wear gloves/eye protection handling high-strength base; remove transdermal patches at night if disturbing dreams; avoid vaping battery misuse/poor-quality cells to reduce explosion/burn risk; and plan caffeine reduction when switching from smoking to nicotine-only delivery.

    "notes": "Harm‑reduction relevant facts and warnings: 1) Dosage and time-course are strongly route-dependent; the widely-circulated 1–2 h total duration is only true for smoked freebase—insufflated and IM commonly last 3–4 h with 2–4 h after-effects. Plan set, setting, and sitter time accordingly. 2) Smoked/vaporized use requires the freebase; DPT salts (e.g., HCl) are unsuitable for vaporization and may decompose under heat. Do not attempt to smoke salts. 3) Nasal administration often causes significant burning, tearing, and congestion; splitting doses, gentle saline rinses post‑session, and avoiding damaged mucosa may reduce harm, but the irritation can still be severe. Experienced users and Erowid’s primer emphasize the substance can be physically and psychologically intense even at seemingly modest insufflated doses. 4) Intramuscular use should only be attempted with sterile technique: use new sterile syringes/needles, sterile diluent, appropriate filtration, skin prep, and never share or reuse injection equipment. Rotate sites and avoid intravenous injection. Community injection HR guides stress these basics to reduce infection and tissue injury. 5) Individual sensitivity varies widely; steep dose–response is reported. Start low, especially with new batches or ROAs. Erowid collations and TIHKAL describe effective IM ranges as low as 15–30 mg and very challenging experiences above ~50–75 mg. 6) Combining DPT with MAOIs (or MAOI‑like drugs) can unpredictably potentiate effects and increase risk of hypertensive or serotonergic crises; avoid this combination. TripSit’s combo guidance flags MAOIs with psychedelics as dangerous. 7) DXM and tramadol are unsafe with serotonergic psychedelics due to seizure and serotonin syndrome risk; avoid. 8) Lithium has a history of severe adverse reactions with classical psychedelics (including seizures); although data are LSD‑focused, prudence dictates avoiding lithium with DPT. 9) DPT appears weakly active orally; if taken this way, expect slower onset, higher dose requirements, more nausea/body‑load, and longer after‑effects. Many prefer non‑oral ROAs for more predictable results. 10) Verify identity: indole tryptamines generally react purple with Ehrlich reagent, which confirms an indole but not the specific compound; only lab testing can confirm identity and purity. 11) Psychological effects can be extremely intense (ego dissolution, fear, tremor); a trusted sober sitter, quiet environment, and clear intention reduce risk of panic and accidents. Erowid’s primer explicitly cautions that DPT is not for casual/recreational mindsets. 12) Tolerance: like other serotonergic psychedelics, acute tolerance develops rapidly and cross‑tolerance with other psychedelics is expected; many harm‑reduction sources recommend at least 1–2 weeks between substantial experiences for baseline sensitivity. DMT may be an exception, but DPT’s longer action suggests ordinary psychedelic tolerance patterns. This guideline is precautionary. 13) Cardiovascular stimulation (transient increases in heart rate/blood pressure), tremor, nausea, and anxiety are commonly reported; those with significant cardiovascular, seizure, or severe psychiatric histories should avoid or take extra precautions in clinical settings. This is a cautious extrapolation from psychedelic HR literature and DPT user reports. 14) Statements sometimes seen online that DPT is “less prone to lasting psychological trauma than LSD or psilocybin” are not evidence-based; reports span from blissful to profoundly challenging. Treat DPT as at least as psychologically powerful as other classic psychedelics. ",

Both 4‑MPM and its positional isomer 3‑MPM have circulated on the NPS market; analytical differentiation requires chromatography/spectroscopy (e.g., GC‑MS, NMR), and simple color reagents are not reliable for distinguishing isomers. Intranasal use is often reported to burn and can be followed by a tinnitus‑like head‑ringing; to reduce harm, prefer oral dosing, limit frequency of insufflation, rotate nostrils, and rinse with isotonic saline after sessions. As with other stimulants and entactogens, monitor for overheating in hot/crowded settings: take cooling breaks, sip fluids regularly, and avoid overhydration by including electrolytes; over‑drinking water can cause hyponatremia. Expect typical stimulant side effects (tachycardia, mild blood‑pressure increases, dry mouth, appetite suppression); individuals with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or anxiety disorders should avoid use. Start low, especially with new batches; marketplace variability is high and early analyses found different MPM isomers in commerce. Redosing extends duration but notably increases insomnia and after‑effects; plan at least one full sleep cycle after the offset.

Multiple fatal and non‑fatal intoxications have been reported, commonly with polydrug use. Because it is short‑acting, compulsive redosing is frequently described, which increases acute risks such as hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation, and insomnia. Drug‑checking services repeatedly warn that powders or pills sold as “3‑MMC” or “MDMA” often contain 3‑CMC or mixtures; always test if possible and begin with a small allergy dose when identity is uncertain. 3‑CMC and its isomer iso‑3‑CMC have both been found in the market; iso‑3‑CMC’s toxicity is poorly characterised, and 3‑CMC may degrade to isomeric/by‑products, particularly in solution—avoid pre‑dissolving for storage and keep material dry, cool, and protected from light. Nasal use can be harsh and may increase compulsion to redose; spacing doses and planning a hard stop time reduces harm. Combining with MAOIs, tramadol, or high‑dose serotonergics can precipitate serotonin toxicity (agitation, clonus, hyperthermia); seek urgent care if these occur. For parties or hot environments, avoid overheating: take regular cool‑down breaks, sip electrolytes, and do not overhydrate. Aftercare (sleep, calories, fluids) mitigates ‘cath‑flu’ dysphoria. Avoid driving and hazardous tasks until fully baseline.",

Intranasal use has frequent reports of painful irritation and is not advised. • Because some β‑carbolines can oxidize to permanently charged β‑carbolinium species with dopaminergic toxicity in experimental models, store 9‑Me‑BC away from light/heat, in airtight amber containers; avoid strong oxidizers. This is a theoretical quality-control precaution, not a documented 9‑Me‑BC clinical risk. • Expect insomnia and anxiety if taken late or at higher doses; dose in the morning, avoid caffeine late in the day, and consider non-sedating sleep hygiene first. Sexual side‑effects are reported anecdotally and are plausible by MAOI class effects. • Source quality varies; prefer suppliers providing third‑party analytics.

In animals, agmatine potentiates morphine analgesia and can reduce opioid tolerance; in people, users report potentiation with both RX opioids and kratom—raising sedation/overdose risk if baseline doses are not lowered. Small human data exist: an open‑label case series (n=11 completers) used 2.67 g/day agmatine sulfate for 2 months and reported meaningful reductions in neuropathic pain without major adverse events, but the study had conflicts of interest and no control arm; findings should be considered preliminary. Blood pressure: due to central imidazoline/I1 and alpha‑2 actions, agmatine can lower BP; additive effects occur with clonidine‑like drugs; stand up slowly and avoid rushed dose escalations. Glucose: secondary pharmacology summaries and some preclinical data suggest mild hypoglycemic effects; individuals on insulin or sulfonylureas should monitor for low glucose when starting. Route risks: intranasal use is discouraged—agmatine sulfate is acidic and can cause nasal irritation; scattered user reports describe unpleasant dissociation and anxiety with this route. Psychiatric variability: while some users report anxiolysis or mood lift, others experience flattening, brain fog, anxiety spikes, or depersonalization—if these occur, discontinue. Tolerance/poop‑out: many users report tachyphylaxis with daily use; if using for mood or pain, consider intermittent schedules to assess continued benefit. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, significant renal or hepatic disease: data are insufficient—avoid or use only with medical supervision. As a supplement, product quality varies; prefer products with recent third‑party testing and avoid proprietary blends with unclear agmatine amounts.",

    "notes": "4‑Methylaminorex is active in low milligram doses; use a 0.001 g scale and avoid eyeballing to prevent inadvertent overdose. The drug’s long and variable duration means redosing can cause stacking, markedly prolonging insomnia and cardiovascular strain; spacing doses by many hours and setting a pre‑planned maximum total are protective. Smoking or rapid-onset routes produce strong urges to redose; pre‑measuring total session amounts and keeping ambient temperature cool reduces binge and hyperthermia risk. Aminorex (the parent drug) was linked to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and a CHEST case series described PAH in people exposed to 4‑methylaminorex; recurrent/high‑dose use may increase PAH risk—seek evaluation for unexplained exertional dyspnea, chest pain, or syncope. MAOIs are contraindicated: combining with sympathomimetic stimulants can precipitate hypertensive crises; do not combine with linezolid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, selegiline, or moclobemide. Animal studies show convulsions at high doses and robust dopamine release; avoid co‑administration with tramadol or high‑dose bupropion and in those with seizure history. Combining with MDMA/cathinones or other stimulants increases risks of hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, arrhythmia, and serotonin toxicity; stay cool, rest, and hydrate modestly (e.g., 250–500 mL/h in heat, not exceeding ~500–750 mL/h for prolonged periods). Due to look‑alike aminorex analogues (e.g., 4,4′‑DMAR) implicated in fatalities and mis‑sold products, use a trusted drug checking service when possible and avoid unknown pressed tablets. Insufflation irritates nasal mucosa; rotate nostrils, use isotonic saline, and allow tissue recovery days. Prolonged wakefulness raises psychosis risk; prioritize sleep after effects subside, using non‑alcoholic, non‑sedative sleep hygiene measures first; seek medical care for chest pain, severe headache, overheating, or confusion.",

    "notes": "Identity risk: 4‑HO‑PiPT is rare in the unregulated market; mislabeling/substitution is plausible. Use multi‑reagent testing (e.g., Ehrlich should turn positive/purple for indoles) and, where available, lab drug checking before ingestion. Begin with an allergy test (0.5–1 mg). Accurate dosing: employ a calibrated 0.001 g scale; for sub‑10 mg adjustments, consider volumetric dosing to reduce measurement error. Salt form matters: like other 4‑sub tryptamines, fumarate vs HCl/freebase alter mg‑for‑mg potency by roughly 10–25%; do not assume vendor salt form—confirm if possible and adjust doses conservatively. Storage: 4‑hydroxy tryptamines readily oxidize, especially in solution or warm/humid conditions; store dry, airtight, light‑protected, with desiccant, ideally frozen. Avoid long‑term liquid storage. Physiology and bodyload: transient tachycardia, mild BP rise, tremors/shivering, jaw tension, nausea, and thermoregulation changes are reported with related 4‑HO tryptamines; plan set/setting and temperature control. Duration/redosing: the short main phase can tempt redosing; however, tolerance accrues rapidly within hours and later redoses often add bodyload more than quality—if redosing, do so early and modestly or avoid altogether. Mental health: as with classics, use can acutely unmask anxiety or, rarely, precipitate issues in predisposed individuals; defer if unstable. Visual after‑effects and rare HPPD‑like symptoms can occur—space sessions (≥2 weeks) and avoid heavy polysubstance use. Interactions: absolutely avoid MAOIs, lithium, and tramadol due to potentiation/seizure/serotonin‑toxicity risks; be cautious with SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, stimulants, dissociatives, and CNS depressants. Safety: do not drive or engage in hazardous tasks until fully baseline (usually next day). Consider a trusted sober sitter for first trials. Seek medical help for red‑flag signs of serotonin toxicity (agitation, hyperthermia, clonus, tremor, diaphoresis).",

    "notes": "Lorazepam is a GABA-A positive allosteric modulator that produces sedation, anxiolysis, muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant effects, and anterograde amnesia; mixing with alcohol or opioids greatly increases respiratory depression risk and overdose potential. It is primarily cleared by phase II glucuronidation to lorazepam-glucuronide (minimal CYP involvement), so classic CYP interactions are uncommon, but additive CNS depression with other sedatives remains the main hazard. Amnesia and disinhibition are dose-related; redosing while effects are ongoing is a common pathway to blackouts and risky behavior. In older adults, benzodiazepines increase falls, cognitive impairment, and crash risk; use lower doses and avoid driving/operating machinery while affected. Co-use with GHB/GBL or opioids is specifically flagged as dangerous by harm-reduction resources due to strong, unpredictable potentiation and aspiration risk if unconscious; avoid these combinations. Counterfeit tablets and designer benzodiazepines in the illicit market can contain highly potent analogues or incorrect doses; avoid non-prescribed products and be cautious with unknown sources. In suspected overdose, supportive care is first-line; flumazenil is generally avoided in chronic benzodiazepine users because it can precipitate severe withdrawal and seizures. Parenteral lorazepam (not oral) contains propylene glycol; prolonged high-dose IV use can cause propylene glycol toxicity—this is not a concern for standard oral dosing but matters in hospital settings. During lactation, usual maternal doses appear compatible with breastfeeding, but infants should be monitored for sedation or poor feeding. Abrupt cessation after repeated use may cause withdrawal (including seizures); any taper should be gradual and medically supervised. ",

Older adults and people with hepatic/renal impairment are more susceptible to sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and falls; dose conservatively and rise slowly. Additive CNS depression occurs with alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z‑drugs, sedating antihistamines, and opioids; avoid driving or hazardous tasks until individual response is known. Serotonin syndrome from mirtazapine alone is rare but reported; risk increases with MAOIs, methylene blue/linezolid, and other serotonergic agents (e.g., DXM, tramadol, triptans); seek urgent care if symptoms such as agitation, tremor, clonus, hyperreflexia, or hyperthermia emerge. Rare but serious blood dyscrasias (neutropenia/agranulocytosis) can occur; stop and obtain urgent evaluation for fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers, or signs of infection. Weight gain and increased appetite are common; monitor weight and lipids during long‑term use. Elevations in liver enzymes and rare liver injury have been reported; evaluate persistent RUQ pain, jaundice, or dark urine. Mania/hypomania may emerge in bipolar disorder; screen for bipolarity prior to starting and monitor for mood switches. Orthostatic hypotension may occur due to peripheral α1 antagonism; rise slowly and hydrate, particularly at initiation. Psychedelics (LSD/psilocybin) are commonly blunted owing to 5‑HT2A antagonism; subjective responses vary, and combinations can be unpredictable. Fluvoxamine and other CYP inhibitors may raise mirtazapine exposure; monitor for excess sedation and consider dose adjustment. For overdose, there is no antidote; management is supportive with airway protection and cardiac monitoring.",

Source: StatPearls (pharmacokinetics). Reasoning 2 — Urine alkalinization: Raising urinary pH (≈8) can reduce clearance ~80%, substantially increasing exposure and adverse-effect risk; this occurs with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide, topiramate, zonisamide) and alkalinizing agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate, potassium citrate). List alkalinizers as dangerous/unsafe interactions. Source: StatPearls (drug–drug interactions); StatPearls (cystinuria management showing potassium citrate alkalinizes urine). Reasoning 3 — Renal impairment: In moderate–severe renal impairment, AUC roughly increases 60–115% and half-life increases 41–95%; recreational high dosing should be avoided or minimized to prevent prolonged toxicity. Source: StatPearls (renal impairment PK). Reasoning 4 — CNS depressants: Memantine can cause dizziness/somnolence; combining with alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines or barbiturates increases risks of accidents, aspiration, and amnesia. This is a general CNS safety principle supported by the memantine adverse-effect profile. Source: StatPearls (adverse effects). Reasoning 5 — Other NMDA antagonists: Combining with amantadine, ketamine, or dextromethorphan increases neuropsychiatric adverse events; therefore, list as dangerous/unsafe combinations. Source: StatPearls. Reasoning 6 — Cardiovascular and stimulant caution: Memantine has been associated with hypertension and tachycardia; stimulants and nicotine can additively increase heart rate/blood pressure; advise caution, especially in CVD. Source: StatPearls (adverse effects). Reasoning 7 — Psychiatric risk: Uncommon adverse effects include hallucinations, agitation, and rare serious neuropsychiatric syndromes; mania-like reactions are reported anecdotally with high/repeated doses. Warn users with mood/psychotic disorders. Source: StatPearls (adverse effects); user reports. Reasoning 8 — Driving/next-day impairment: Due to long half-life and delayed offset, cognition/coordination can remain impaired ≥24–72 h; advise against driving/operating machinery the day of use and potentially the following day. Supported by PK and many user reports describing prolonged after-effects. Sources: StatPearls; user reports. Reasoning 9 — Route of administration: Non-oral routes are discouraged; IM reports note burning/irritation and unpredictable kinetics. Emphasize oral-only. Source: Bluelight first-time caution thread. Reasoning 10 — Titration/redosing: Because onset may be delayed (1–3 h) and effects last long, early redosing can result in stacking and protracted dissociation; advise small single trials and avoid boosters within the same day. Sources: StatPearls (onset for ER; long t1/2) and user reports/experience vaults. Reasoning 11 — Hepatic safety: Clinically apparent hepatotoxicity is rare, but has been reported; advise avoiding heavy alcohol binges and monitoring for jaundice if used repeatedly. Source: LiverTox. Reasoning 12 — Pregnancy/lactation/pediatrics: Safety not established; avoid non-medical use in pregnancy or while breastfeeding and avoid pediatric exposure. Source: StatPearls. Reasoning 13 — Product form: Distinguish IR vs ER; do not crush ER beads; verify tablet identity (avoid counterfeits). Source: StatPearls (dosage forms/ER specifics). Reasoning 14 — Set/setting and sitter: Dissociation plus amnesia raises accident risk; a sober sitter and safe environment reduce harms; Erowid experiential literature repeatedly highlights prolonged and unpredictable effects.

    "notes": "• Pharmacology: Naphyrone is a pyrrolidinophenone cathinone that functions primarily as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor (DAT/NET/SERT), producing cocaine‑like stimulant effects; this mechanism increases the risk of serotonin toxicity if combined with serotonergic drugs. • Adulteration/mislabeling: Products sold as “NRG‑1/Energy‑1” in 2010–2011 were frequently mislabelled, often containing mephedrone, MDPV, or other cathinones instead of naphyrone; assume contents are uncertain without lab testing. • Potency and dosing: User reports place active doses in the tens of milligrams with a long duration and strong compulsion to redose; precision weighing and single‑dose session planning are strongly advised. • Duration/after‑effects: Even modest doses can produce prolonged stimulation and insomnia (12–24 h after‑effects); avoid late‑day dosing and plan adequate sleep recovery. • Cardiovascular/thermal risk: As a potent stimulant, naphyrone may raise heart rate and blood pressure and can contribute to hyperthermia; avoid hot environments, sustained exertion, and stacking other stimulants. • Hydration/nutrition: Sip fluids periodically and consider electrolytes; avoid over‑hydration. Dry mouth and urinary hesitancy are reported with related cathinones; schedule bathroom breaks. General safer‑use guidance from drug checking services warns that powder/crystal products are frequently misdeclared—prefer lab testing. • ROA cautions: Insufflation can cause significant nasal/throat irritation and headaches; oral dosing is perceived as smoother by many users. Avoid IV/rectal routes due to potency and unknown excipients. • Tolerance/compulsion: Acute tolerance within a session and strong urges to redose are described with pyrrolidinophenones; spacing use and avoiding binges reduces risk. Animal data support meaningful reinforcement. • Mixed animal PK: Rodent studies conflict on elimination speed and tissue distribution; human half‑life is unknown. Do not assume short plasma half‑life equates to short subjective effects; plan conservatively. • Testing: Because of historic mislabeling of “NRG‑1,” reagent tests may be insufficient; where possible, use professional drug‑checking (FTIR/GC‑MS) and avoid redosing until effects are fully known.

    "notes": "• Identity and purity: Mislabeling and substitutions are common in the NPS market. Where possible, use an official drug checking service (GC‑MS/FT‑IR). If no lab testing is available, test a very small dose first and wait; for oral use, wait at least 2 hours before considering more. Use your own snorting equipment to reduce infection risk.\n• Dosing discipline: Start low and go slow. Pre‑measure doses with a milligram scale. For faster routes (insufflated/rectal), pre‑plan a maximum total session amount to reduce chasing effects. TripSit provides a volumetric dosing tool and combination guidance.\n• Heat and hydration: Stimulants increase body temperature and fluid loss. Take regular cool‑down breaks if active/hot, sip fluids slowly, and avoid overhydration. A practical rule-of-thumb from clubbing harm‑reduction: about one pint (~500 mL) per hour when exerting, with breaks; do not force excessive water (risk of hyponatremia).\n• Cardiovascular risk: Like other synthetic stimulants, 2-FEA may elevate heart rate and blood pressure. Avoid combining with other stimulants, and people with cardiovascular disease should be especially cautious or avoid use.\n• Redosing/compulsion: Stimulants can promote compulsive redosing. To reduce risk, plan session limits, store the remainder out of reach/sight, and consider having a trusted person hold the supply.\n• Nasal health: If insufflating, use your own straw/tube, avoid frequent large lines, and gently rinse with saline after sessions to reduce irritation.\n• Sleep and comedown: Expect insomnia and a low mood the following day. Prioritize rest, nutrition, and rehydration. Avoid using alcohol, benzodiazepines, or opioids to force sleep due to interaction risks.\n• Evidence limits: There are no controlled human pharmacokinetic studies for 2-FEA. All typical dose/duration ranges here are from user reports; individual responses vary widely. Prefer lab confirmation and conservative titration. (General NPS preparedness guidance.) ",

Reagents cannot confirm 4‑MeO‑MiPT identity; send to a lab if possible.\n• Measurement matters: Use a 0.001 g scale or volumetric dosing for precise titration of small doses. Avoid eyeballing powders. TripSit provides a volumetric converter tool.\n• Duration tends to be short/moderate with a tactile, sociable headspace; several users find 20–30 mg oral to produce mild-to-moderate effects with limited visuals. Stronger effects are possible near the top of the range; titrate cautiously.\n• Combining 4‑oxygenated tryptamines with 5‑MeO tryptamines can yield unexpectedly strong effects; if combining at all, lower both doses and have a sitter.\n• Polydrug risks: The general combo literature flags MAOIs, tramadol, DXM, and serotonergic antidepressants as higher‑risk pairings due to serotonin toxicity or seizure risk; treat these as contraindicated unless medically supervised.\n• Because samples are rare and data sparse, expect variability across batches and treat all data as provisional; prefer single‑substance trials and avoid stacking on first exposures.",

Anecdotal reports suggest a relatively brief and sometimes wave-like course orally, with some users noting mild rebound headaches; plan set, setting, and next-day commitments accordingly. Given the scarcity of pharmacokinetic data, avoid redosing quickly, as delayed absorption or batch variability could cause unexpectedly strong effects. Several users describe severe nasal burn and irritation with insufflation; oral use is the least caustic known route and is the default for most 4-hydroxy tryptamines. As with other serotonergic psychedelics, avoid combining with lithium due to a substantially increased seizure risk observed when classic psychedelics are taken with lithium; this applies even at therapeutic lithium levels. MAOIs can markedly potentiate tryptamines and increase risks (e.g., hypertensive reactions and serotonin toxicity), so this combination should be strictly avoided outside clinical settings. Tramadol lowers seizure threshold and has serotonergic activity; combining with psychedelics increases seizure and adverse neuropsychiatric risk and should be avoided. Stimulants (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine) can amplify anxiety, cardiovascular strain, and thought loops; avoid or use extreme caution if you have any cardiovascular, anxiety, or panic history. SSRIs/SNRIs often blunt the subjective effects of psychedelics but can still interact unpredictably; if on antidepressants, avoid DIY discontinuation and consult a clinician instead of mixing. Because unregulated markets frequently mislabel tryptamines (e.g., 4-HO-MET sold as psilocybin), use accredited drug checking where available, recognizing that at-home reagents are helpful but not definitive. Perform a low-dose allergy test with any new batch and use accurate scales; start at threshold if untested. Individuals with a personal or family history of seizures, serious cardiovascular disease, or current manic states should avoid experimental tryptamines like 4-HO-McPT. Have a sober, trusted sitter for first trials, avoid alcohol or sedatives to “manage” the trip, and seek medical help promptly for severe agitation, chest pain, uncontrolled vomiting, loss of consciousness, or convulsions.",

    "notes": "Identity/analysis: Benzylpiperazines like BZP typically do not react with Marquis or Scott but give a positive with Nitroprusside; some cross-react with methamphetamine urine immunoassays. Without full lab analysis, misidentification is common, including sale as MDMA; use reputable drug checking where available. Pharmacology/extrapolation: BZP acts as a CNS stimulant roughly ~10% potency of d-amphetamine and mCPP shows serotonergic effects with 4–8 h duration; metabolism for BZP appears to involve CYP2D6/COMT with polymorphism-driven variability. Given this, expect wide person-to-person differences in both potency and duration with this trimethoxybenzyl analogue; begin with allergy testing and titrate conservatively. Cardiovascular risk: BZP in humans increases heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size; similar effects should be assumed. Avoid if you have cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or are on QT-prolonging or pressor medications. Heat/overexertion: Stimulant/serotonergic actions raise hyperthermia risk, especially when combined with other stimulants/MDMA or in hot venues; take regular cooling breaks and sip isotonic fluids (avoid overhydration). Seizure risk: Clinical case series link BZP exposure with seizures; avoid combinations that lower seizure threshold (e.g., tramadol, bupropion) and avoid sleep deprivation. Serotonin toxicity: Combining with serotonergic agents (MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, MDMA/MDA, DXM, tramadol, lithium) increases serotonin syndrome risk (agitation, clonus, hyperthermia, diaphoresis); do not mix and seek urgent care if symptoms appear. Redosing/spacing: Because piperazine kinetics vary (BZP t1/2 ~5–6 h; mCPP ~2.6–6.1 h), allow at least 24 hours before considering any redose and at least 1–2 weeks between sessions to limit tolerance and adverse effects. Route-of-use cautions: Avoid insufflation—piperazines are irritants and can damage mucosa; oral use is standard in reports. Post-use insomnia and anxiety are common; plan for sleep hygiene and a quiet environment. Drug testing: Immunoassay false-positives for methamphetamine are possible with some piperazines; request confirmatory GC/MS if relevant. Unknowns: No human pharmacokinetic or receptor-binding data exist for this exact trimethoxybenzyl isomer; long-term safety (including potential 5‑HT2B–related valvulopathy seen with some serotonergics) is unknown—avoid frequent or chronic use.",

Prefer oral administration if experimenting at all.\n• Strongly avoid combining with MAOIs, tramadol, DXM, MDMA, or other potent serotonergic/stimulant drugs due to seizure, hypertensive, and serotonin‑toxicity concerns.\n• Because of dose sensitivity and rarity/mislabelling risks, identify material with multiple reagents when possible and consider submitting a tiny sample to a drug checking service; some phenethylamines produce overlapping reagent colors and cannot be distinguished without lab analysis.\n• Expect typical psychedelic mental health cautions: those with personal/family histories of psychotic or bipolar disorders may experience destabilization; ensure safe set/setting and a trusted sober sitter.\n• Tolerance and cross‑tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics develop rapidly; frequent use diminishes effects and may encourage risky redosing—space trials by at least a week (preferably longer).\n• Emergency signs warranting medical help include severe agitation, profuse vomiting with confusion, chest pain, seizures, or loss of consciousness—these have featured in serious 2C‑T‑x adverse events.

    "notes": "Evidence basis and harm-reduction rationale: (1) Pharmacology: 4-BMC is a monoamine releasing substrate at SERT, NET and DAT with higher potency at SERT than DAT, implying empathogenic effects and increased risk of serotonergic toxicity when combined with other serotonergic agents. Avoid combinations with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, 5-HTP, tramadol, DXM, or lithium due to serotonin syndrome risk. (2) Toxicity concerns: Para-halogenated amphetamines/cathinones (e.g., 4-FA, PCA, 4-CMC) show increased SERT potency and mitochondrial toxicity in vitro; 4-CMC impairs mitochondrial function and increases ROS in neuronal models. While direct human neurotoxicity data for 4-BMC are lacking, these data justify conservative dosing, long spacing between uses, and meticulous avoidance of redosing. (3) Mis-selling/adulteration: Multiple Swiss drug checking alerts in 2025 found 4-BMC sold as 3‑MMC or 4‑CMC; earlier Energy Control data (2014–2016) showed low label accuracy for cathinones. Use drug checking services, and if unavailable, do an allergy test and start with a very small dose. (4) ROA safety: Insufflation increases adverse effects (nasal pain/bleeds, sinusitis) and systemic stimulation; oral route has a wider margin of safety and smoother onset. If snorted, avoid repeated lines, space lines widely, and rinse with isotonic saline after. (5) Temperature/hydration: As with MDMA-like agents, risk of hyperthermia and hyponatremia exists; take breaks from dancing, cool down, sip fluids steadily, but avoid overhydration. Consider electrolyte-containing drinks; do not exceed normal thirst-driven intake. Seek help immediately for confusion, agitation, clonus, hyperthermia, or severe GI symptoms. (6) Cardiovascular caution: Ring‑substituted cathinones can increase HR/BP; 4‑CMC raised BP/HR in rats, suggesting similar stimulant cardiovascular effects may occur with 4‑BMC. Avoid if you have cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or are on QT‑prolonging meds. (7) Spacing/redosing: Given serotonergic mechanism and halogenation toxicity signals, avoid redosing; if used at all, single-session dosing with long breaks (≥6–8 weeks) is prudent (MDMA guidance: months between uses). (8) Bruxism/jaw tension and headaches are common with stimulants; some users find a mouthguard/chewing gum helpful; magnesium is sometimes reported to ease bruxism—remain within dietary guidelines and avoid if contraindicated. (9) Market dynamics: EUDA notes renewed 4‑BMC availability in 2024–2025 across the EU market, underlining the importance of up-to-date alerts and checking. ",

    "notes": "4‑MEC is a synthetic cathinone with a short human use history; availability often followed mephedrone controls and products may be mislabelled or adulterated (e.g., sold as 3‑MMC or even ketamine), so test before use and titrate cautiously. 4‑MEC likely acts as a mixed monoamine stimulant/entactogen; as with serotonergic cathinones like 4‑MMC, combining with MAOIs or serotonergic agents (SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM) increases risk of serotonin toxicity and should be avoided. Stimulant risks include tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, vasoconstriction, bruxism, and insomnia; risk rises with dose and rapid redosing. Insufflation causes local irritation and, with repetition, can damage nasal mucosa; use your own clean utensil, saline rinse, switch nostrils, and rest the nose. Injecting cathinones adds significant harm (vein and tissue injury, infection) and can encourage compulsive redosing; if someone proceeds despite risks, sterile technique (new syringe, sterile water, filtration, site prep) reduces—but does not remove—harms. Redose compulsion (“fiending”) is frequently reported; spacing use (e.g., multiple weeks) reduces neuro/psychological stress and helps sleep and nutrition recover. The same name (‘4‑MEC’) has appeared in branded blends (e.g., ‘NRG‑2’) and non-analysed powders; do not assume purity or identity without drug checking. Formal pharmacokinetics (e.g., half-life) in humans remain poorly defined; expect variability across batches and individuals. Compared with 4‑MMC, 4‑MEC is often described as less potent and somewhat more sedating by users, but objective potency and toxicity data are limited—dose conservatively.",

Pre‑workout and ‘energy’ products that list DMHA/Octodrine often include additional stimulants (e.g., caffeine, synephrine, higenamine, yohimbine), which can significantly increase heart rate, blood pressure, and adverse-event risk; single-ingredient use reduces uncertainty from proprietary blends. The hydrochloride vs freebase salt, product purity, and inaccurate labels can change potency by tens of percent; start low, go slow, and avoid redosing until well past the onset window. As a sympathomimetic, DMHA may worsen hypertension, arrhythmias, anxiety, and insomnia; avoid if you have cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled thyroid disease, or panic disorder, and do not use late in the day. Mixing with MAOIs can precipitate hypertensive crises; stacking with other stimulants (including ‘fat burners’) increases risks of tachycardia, hyperthermia, and vasoconstriction—particularly during strenuous exercise. Alcohol can mask intoxication from stimulants and add strain on the heart; if used, avoid combining and ensure cooling, hydration, and rest during workouts. Intranasal use can cause pronounced nasal irritation and local vasoconstriction; oral routes are generally lower-risk. Tolerance to stimulant effects builds rapidly with frequent use; spacing use (days to weeks) lowers crash/insomnia and reduces escalation. Legal/regulatory note: the U.S. FDA considers supplements containing DMHA to be adulterated; products may be seized or reformulated without notice, adding supply variability and labeling uncertainty.",

    "notes": "Misrepresentation risk: Alerts in Australia documented 25B‑NBOH sold as powdered “LSD,” with hospitalizations reported; be highly skeptical of any powder claimed to be LSD, and test before use. NBOH/NBOMe can also appear on blotter or in liquid. Reagent testing: LSD typically turns Ehrlich/Hofmann purple; NBOH/NBOMe generally do not react with Ehrlich, and may show yellow/green reactions on Marquis/Mecke depending on concentration. Reagents have limits; where possible use lab drug checking. Handling and dosing: Microgram potency makes weighing powder impractical without lab methods. Volumetric dosing and strict labeling, PPE (gloves, eye protection, mask), and avoiding drafts are recommended when handling high‑potency phenethylamines. Route of administration: Activity is via mucosal absorption (buccal/sublingual). Swallowing reduces activity compared with LSD; this distinction is one reason some advise swallowing unknown blotter if bitterness suggests NBx contamination, but this is not a guarantee of safety. Redosing: For NBOMe/NBOH‑like phenethylamines, response is highly variable and can escalate somatic side effects; Swiss harm‑reduction services explicitly warn to avoid redosing 25B/25C‑NBOMe. Extrapolating to NBOH, avoid redosing due to similar potency, ROA, and unpredictability. Cardiovascular/vasoconstriction: NBOMe reports include marked peripheral vasoconstriction (cold/blue digits, swelling, cramping) requiring medical attention; avoid vasoconstrictive combos and monitor extremities. NBOH appears similar in profile based on user reports. Seek help for severe numbness, cyanosis, or chest pain. Acute toxicity profile: Public alerts for 25B‑NBOH cite risks of seizures, extreme agitation, hyperthermia, acute kidney injury, and death; risk rises with stimulant co‑use or non‑buccal routes (snorting/injecting). Set/setting and temperature: As with stimulating psychedelics, minimize overheating (cool environment, light clothing), maintain hydration and electrolytes, and avoid strenuous activity. Medication interactions: Avoid MAOIs, tramadol, and DXM due to serotonergic and seizure‑threshold concerns; lithium is specifically cautioned against with serotonergic psychedelics; SSRIs/SNRIs may blunt effects yet unpredictability remains. Tolerance: Psychedelic tolerance builds rapidly and typically requires 1–2 weeks to reset; cross‑tolerance is expected with other 5‑HT2A psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, 2C‑x/NBOMe). Do not escalate doses within the same session to chase effects. Product variability: DIY or poorly laid blotters can be uneven; inconsistent potency has been reported for NBOH blotters, increasing the risk of unexpected intensity. Taste myths: A strong bitter/metallic taste and mouth numbness can suggest NBOMe/NBOH, but taste alone is unreliable; inks/solvents can also be bitter. Use reagents and, ideally, lab testing. ",

Biased μ-opioid receptor agonism has not eliminated respiratory depression in humans (e.g., oliceridine showed only modest improvements), so standard opioid overdose risks should be assumed. SR-17018 and related ligands have been described as sustaining G-protein signaling and acting noncompetitively in vitro/animal models; practically, this may make effects feel longer or redoses stack unpredictably, so long intervals between doses are prudent. Combining with CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, GHB/GBL) greatly increases risk of life-threatening respiratory depression; avoid polydrug use. If an opioid overdose is suspected (slow or stopped breathing, blue lips, unresponsive), administer naloxone promptly, repeat if needed, and call emergency services. Supply quality is highly variable; reports of scams and mislabeling exist, so assume unknown purity and consider professional drug checking when possible. Use precise measurement tools (milligram scale, volumetric dosing) and perform an allergy test before any psychoactive dose. Expect typical opioid adverse effects (constipation, nausea, pruritus, sedation, miosis, urinary retention); do not drive or operate machinery while affected. Tolerance and physical dependence can still develop with repeated use; claims of reduced tolerance are based on animal models and may not translate to humans. Do not rely on consumer fentanyl strips to assess identity or safety of this compound; comprehensive lab analysis is needed to confirm composition. Avoid use with MAOIs and approach with caution if taking SSRIs/SNRIs (interaction profiles for SR-17018 are unknown).",

    "notes": "Levomethorphan is the levorotatory isomer of methorphan and the methyl ether of levorphanol; levorphanol is a potent μ-opioid agonist with additional κ/δ activity, which explains the significant risk of respiratory depression and dependence seen with levomethorphan exposure. By chemical relationship and analogy to dextromethorphan, levomethorphan is plausibly O‑demethylated in humans (likely via CYP2D6) to levorphanol; this implies strong interindividual variability (UMs higher conversion/toxicity; PMs lower conversion/effect) and sensitivity to CYP2D6 inhibitors such as quinidine or certain SSRIs. Because levorphanol’s elimination half-life is long (≈11–16 h), sedation and respiratory depression may persist or re‑emerge (“renarcotization”) after apparent improvement; in overdose, multiple naloxone doses or an infusion and prolonged observation can be required. Combining levomethorphan with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, Z-drugs, gabapentinoids, first‑generation antihistamines, GHB/GBL) markedly increases overdose risk due to additive respiratory depression; avoid such combinations and use smallest effective doses if medically required. Some opioids have serotonergic properties (tramadol, methadone, tapentadol, meperidine), so mixing levomethorphan with these agents increases the risk of serotonin toxicity and seizures; avoid or use only under medical supervision. Given inconsistent supply chains and frequent high‑potency adulterants in the unregulated opioid market (fentanyl, analogs, nitazenes; sometimes veterinary tranquilizers), use verified drug‑checking services where available and start with a very small test dose; be aware that higher-than-usual naloxone doses may be needed when multiple high‑potency opioids are present. Always keep naloxone available, educate peers on its use, and call emergency services immediately during suspected overdose; naloxone’s action is shorter than many opioids, so re-dosing at 2–5 minute intervals and observation for 6–12 hours may be necessary. Use a calibrated milligram scale for measurement; avoid non-oral routes (insufflation, injection, smoking) due to rapid onset and sharply increased overdose risk. People with sleep‑disordered breathing, COPD, hepatic impairment, or concurrent sedative prescriptions are at elevated risk for respiratory depression and should avoid nonmedical use and seek medical guidance if prescribed opioids.",

    "notes": "PCP has a steep dose-response curve; small increases in dose can abruptly shift effects from mild dissociation to delirium, psychosis, or dangerous agitation—start low and allow full onset before any redose. Lipid solubility and an average elimination half-life near a day mean effects can recur or fluctuate for 24–48 hours; avoid stacking doses and do not drive or operate machinery during this window. Smoked ‘wet/fry/embalming fluid’ products are slang for liquid PCP on plant material; do not smoke actual embalming solutions (formaldehyde is carcinogenic) and avoid unknown dipped products. Dissociation and analgesia reduce pain perception—use in a safe environment with a trusted sober sitter, and remove hazards (heights, water, traffic, sharp objects) to mitigate trauma risk. Hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and dehydration can occur at high doses or with agitation; prioritize cooling, rest, and fluids, and seek urgent care if muscle pain, dark urine, or confusion develop. Polysubstance use magnifies risks: alcohol and GHB/GBL markedly increase blackout/aspiration and coma risk; stimulants raise the chance of hypertensive crisis, hyperthermia, and manic psychosis; opioids and benzodiazepines add sedation and amnesia. Clinically, benzodiazepines are first-line to treat PCP-related agitation, hypertension, seizures, and hyperthermia; outside medical supervision, intentional co-use is discouraged due to blackout and accident risk. Intranasal use can be caustic and salt-dependent in onset; avoid large lines, split doses, and wait at least 30–60 minutes to assess effects. Street PCP varies widely in potency and is often misrepresented; start with allergy/threshold doses, and prefer verified, lab-tested materials where possible. People with a history of psychosis, bipolar mania, seizure disorders, significant cardiovascular disease, or uncontrolled hypertension may face substantially higher risks and should avoid use.",

    "notes": "Diazepam is long-acting and lipophilic; repeated or high doses can accumulate in fat with slow redistribution, causing prolonged next-day sedation and impaired coordination—avoid redosing to chase euphoria. Benzodiazepines plus opioids or alcohol markedly increase risk of respiratory depression, coma, and death; this combination carries an FDA boxed warning and should be strictly avoided. In older adults, paradoxical agitation, disinhibition, confusion, and falls are more likely; use the lowest possible dose or avoid non-prescribed use in this group. Hepatic impairment (cirrhosis, hepatitis) extends diazepam half-life substantially; even usual doses can over-sedate—avoid self-escalation and seek medical guidance. Diazepam is metabolized mainly by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4; strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolides, protease inhibitors; some SSRIs and PPIs) can raise levels and increase sedation, while inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St John’s wort) can reduce effect unpredictably. Grapefruit products inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 and can raise exposure to several benzodiazepines; effect on diazepam may be smaller due to CYP2C19 involvement, but increased sedation is still possible—avoid co-use. Avoid driving, cycling, operating machinery, or risky activities for at least the day of use and until you feel fully alert the next day. Do not inject tablets or non-sterile solutions; IV diazepam requires medical-grade formulation and slow administration due to risks of apnea, hypotension, and solvent-related toxicity. Rectal and intranasal medical products exist for seizures but are not appropriate for recreational use. Abrupt cessation after days-to-weeks of regular use can cause severe withdrawal (anxiety, tremor, perceptual changes) and, at higher dependence levels, seizures; cessation should be gradual under medical supervision. Flumazenil can reverse benzodiazepine sedation but may precipitate withdrawal and seizures in dependent users; it is not a general safety net for non-medical use. Pregnancy and breastfeeding: diazepam crosses the placenta and enters breast milk; prenatal exposure is linked to neonatal withdrawal and floppy infant syndrome, and infants may become excessively sedated—avoid non-prescribed use and seek medical advice. Unregulated drug supplies can contain unexpected benzodiazepines or be co-formulated with opioids or veterinary tranquilizers; when available, use drug checking services and avoid unknown tablets.",

    "notes": "25B‑NBOH is active in the microgram range; inaccurate measurement (e.g., eyeballing powder) greatly increases overdose risk and should be avoided. NBx compounds (NBOH/NBOMe) have produced severe adverse effects including vasoconstriction, agitation, seizures, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis in clinical case series; medical evaluation is warranted for symptoms like chest pain, blue/cold extremities, prolonged confusion, or seizure. Buccal/sublingual absorption is the primary active route; swallowing reduces effects variably, and redosing during a slow onset has led to accidental overdoses with related NBx. 25B‑NBOH has been mis-sold as ‘LSD’ (including in powder form, which is atypical for LSD); use multi-reagent testing and drug checking where available. Ehrlich reagent turns purple for indole lysergamides (e.g., LSD) but shows no color with NBOH/NBOMe; Hofmann/Marquis patterns can add context—however, reagent tests are screening tools, not definitive IDs. Bitter taste and localized oral numbing are commonly reported with NBx, but taste is not a reliable identification method and should not replace testing. Strong stimulatory combinations (e.g., with amphetamines or cocaine) elevate risks of hypertension and dangerous vasoconstriction beyond either drug alone. Tramadol lowers seizure threshold and has been repeatedly associated with seizures when combined with serotonergic psychedelics; avoid. Lithium has many consistent reports of severe adverse reactions, including seizures, when combined with classical psychedelics; given the similar 5‑HT2A agonism of NBOH compounds, this combination should be considered high‑risk. SSRIs often blunt psychedelic effects via receptor downregulation; they are not reliable ‘safety buffers’ and may complicate responses—avoid intentional mixing. Cannabis can unpredictably potentiate psychedelics and anxiety; titrate cautiously or avoid. Tolerance to 5‑HT2A agonists can be pronounced for days; allow at least 1–2 weeks between strong psychedelic sessions to reduce the urge to escalate dose. Seek immediate care for signs of hyperthermia (hot, confused, profuse sweating), chest pain, severe headache, seizure activity, or new neurologic deficits.",

    "notes": "Reasoning and justification for harm-reduction updates (with sources): 1) SR‑17018 remains preclinical in the formal literature with no published human PK/PD; most information derives from animal/cellular studies and anecdotal reports. PubMed indexes mechanistic and animal studies but no human trials to date; therefore dose/time-course guidance is low‑confidence and must be framed as experimental. 2) Mechanistically, SR‑17018 shows atypical MOR signaling and persistent receptor phosphorylation reversible by naloxone; this implies effects can outlast subjective euphoria and that naloxone should still work in overdose. Users should avoid redosing too early and ensure naloxone is on hand. 3) In mice, chronic SR‑17018 produces less antinociceptive tolerance than morphine in some assays and can reverse morphine tolerance, which implies that a person’s tolerance to their usual opioid may fall during/after SR‑17018 use. Returning to a previous opioid dose can therefore be dangerous; dose much lower than usual and titrate. 4) The fall in opioid tolerance during abstinence or after detox is a known overdose risk; similar caution applies here when tolerance is reduced. 5) Combining any opioid with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants increases risk of respiratory depression and fatal outcomes; include gabapentinoids given observed overdose risk when co‑prescribed with opioids. Avoid these combinations. 6) MAOIs with opioids carry documented hazardous and unpredictable interactions; avoid unless medically supervised. 7) Community reports show very wide dose ranges (tens to low hundreds of mg per dose) and frequent redosing every 6–12 h. This variability indicates batch potency differences and underscores the need for accurate weighing/volumetric dosing and conservative titration. 8) Several users report substantial tolerance reduction and muted effects of other opioids while on SR‑17018; after pausing SR‑17018, effects of other opioids may be unexpectedly strong. This supports start‑low/go‑slow if reintroducing a full agonist. 9) Do not assume absence of withdrawal with SR‑17018; some users report difficulty stopping after multi‑week use. Plan short durations and taper if needed. 10) Always treat SR‑17018 as a potent experimental opioid: avoid driving or hazardous work, use with a trusted sober person when first trialing, and keep naloxone available. General opioid overdose management guidance applies. 11) Because products are sourced from an unregulated market, expect variable identity/purity and scams; where possible, use drug checking and avoid unknown vendors. Community moderation posts flag recurrent scammers; treat supply chains skeptically. Additional consolidated guidance: • Start low, go slow; wait a full 6–12 h before redosing due to potentially persistent receptor effects. • If transitioning back to another opioid, begin at a fraction of prior dose (e.g., ≤25–50%) and titrate over days, watching for oversedation. • Avoid co‑administration with benzodiazepines, alcohol, Z‑drugs, GHB/GBL, or gabapentinoids; if already dependent on any, seek medical input before changes. • Naloxone should reverse SR‑17018‑related respiratory depression; multiple doses may be required. • No evidence that SR‑17018 is serotonergic; serotonin‑toxicity risk appears low relative to agents like tramadol/methadone, though data are sparse—exercise usual caution with serotonergic polypharmacy.

Because CYP2D6 activity varies widely across individuals and is inhibited by several common medicines (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, bupropion), the rate and extent of conversion to levorphanol may be unpredictable; effects can be delayed or prolonged.

The active metabolite levorphanol is a potent opioid (roughly 4–8× morphine potency) with a long elimination half‑life (~11–16 h), which increases the risk of accumulation and delayed respiratory depression, particularly with repeated dosing. Due to opioid class effects and probable kappa activity, adverse effects can include respiratory depression, sedation, nausea, pruritus, constipation, miosis, and occasionally dysphoria or hallucinations. Combining levomethorphan/levorphanol with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB/GBL) markedly elevates overdose risk; avoid these combinations and ensure access to naloxone. Co‑use with gabapentinoids also increases overdose risk in population studies; avoid unless medically supervised. In suspected overdose, naloxone usually reverses toxicity, but repeat doses or an infusion may be required because naloxone is shorter‑acting than many opioids; always seek emergency care. If sourcing outside a medical context, be aware that enantiomers (DXM vs LVM) cannot be distinguished by typical home reagent tests; only laboratory analysis (e.g., chiral chromatography) can reliably differentiate them. U.S. legal status is Schedule II (DEA code 9210); penalties can be severe. Individuals with hepatic or renal impairment may have prolonged effects due to levorphanol glucuronidation and renal excretion; dose‑stacking is especially dangerous in these groups. Never use alone, avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least 24 h, and titrate cautiously from a very low dose with long intervals.",

Heat injury is a major risk during agitation or restraint; rapid cooling and prompt medical help are lifesaving in severe hyperthermia. Analgesia and dissociation mask injuries — avoid heights, water, stoves, traffic, and never drive for at least a full day after strong effects. Smoked “wet/sherm” is usually PCP solution, not real embalming fluid; formaldehyde is carcinogenic and should not be inhaled. Street strengths vary widely; use milligram-accurate scales and avoid eyeballing crystals or pre-dipped cigarettes. Combination with depressants (alcohol, benzos, opioids, GHB) greatly increases blackout, airway, and aspiration risks; medical teams use benzodiazepines for agitation and seizures — this is not a justification to self-mix. Stimulant co-use (cocaine, amphetamines) raises risks of psychosis, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis. False positives for PCP occur on immunoassay urine screens (e.g., from DXM, venlafaxine, tramadol); confirmatory GC/MS is more specific. If severe agitation, chest pain, seizures, or very high temperature occur, call emergency services; quiet, low-stimulation environments reduce escalation. Consider drug checking where available (FTIR/GC–MS) as PCP may be mis-sold or cut with other arylcyclohexylamines; pre-dipped cigarettes are especially unpredictable. Frequent use builds strong tolerance and can lead to prolonged cognitive and mood disturbances; spacing use by several weeks reduces risk.",

    "notes": "Diazepam is long-acting with active metabolites (desmethyldiazepam/nordazepam, temazepam, oxazepam) that extend sedation and impairment into the next day; this makes redosing particularly risky and increases blackout potential at “strong” doses. Co-use with opioids or alcohol is a leading cause of benzodiazepine-related fatality due to synergistic respiratory depression; avoid combining and ensure take-home naloxone is available if opioids may be present. Food delays and reduces peak concentration; onset may be slower with meals, which can encourage premature redosing—wait at least 2–3 hours before considering any additional dosing. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided the day of use and potentially the following day, especially after 10 mg+ or when CYP inhibitors are on board, due to persistent psychomotor and memory impairment. Paradoxical agitation, disinhibition, or aggression can occur in a minority of users, more often in children, older adults, and those with a history of behavioral dyscontrol; if noted, do not escalate dose. Older adults and people with respiratory disease, sleep apnea, or liver impairment are at higher risk of oversedation and respiratory complications; lower doses and longer spacing are prudent. Abrupt discontinuation after regular use can cause severe, potentially life-threatening withdrawal including seizures; any taper should be slow and medically supervised. Flumazenil reverses benzodiazepines but can precipitate seizures in dependent users or mixed overdoses and is not a community-level harm-reduction tool. Do not inject: parenteral diazepam formulations contain solvents (e.g., propylene glycol) with risks of metabolic acidosis and tissue injury; injecting crushed tablets introduces insoluble fillers and infection/embolism risk. Street/online tablets are frequently counterfeited; use drug checking and verify imprint/packaging where possible; potency can vary widely. Pregnancy and breastfeeding: benzodiazepines cross the placenta and are excreted in breast milk; neonatal sedation/withdrawal has been reported—seek medical guidance. Because tolerance develops to sedative effects faster than to anxiolysis in some individuals, escalating for “the same feeling” increases blackout/overdose risk without restoring earlier subjective relief.",

    "notes": "Reasoning and evidence for harm‑reduction additions: (1) Product selection is critical. Only single‑ingredient DXM should be used; many popular OTC syrups and tablets add guaifenesin, acetaminophen, and/or sedating antihistamines that become toxic at recreational quantities; Erowid explicitly warns about APAP and Coricidin/CPM products. (2) Dose planning by mg/kg ‘plateaus’ improves safety compared with crude mg ranges; Erowid details 1.5–2.5, 2.5–7.5, 7.5–15, and >15 mg/kg for HBr. Inter‑individual potency varies as much as five‑fold, so conservative titration is advised. (3) Polistirex (extended‑release) has slower onset and longer duration than HBr and is often perceived as weaker per mg; this increases stacking/overdose risk when users redose too early. Erowid lists 6–12 h duration for polistirex. (4) Pharmacogenetics and inhibitors matter: DXM is O‑demethylated to dextrorphan mainly via CYP2D6; activity varies by genotype and is strongly inhibited by agents like quinidine and bupropion, resulting in much higher and prolonged DXM exposure with more serotonergic/sigma‑like effects and toxicity risk. DrugBank documents CYP2D6 metabolism and a 3–30 h half‑life range, and a clinical study shows bupropion can convert extensive to poor metabolizer phenotype using a DXM probe. (5) Serotonin‑toxicity risk: Combining DXM with SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs/MAOIs and other serotonergics (e.g., MDMA, tramadol) can precipitate serotonin syndrome; StatPearls outlines this and notes hyperthermia, rigidity, and autonomic instability as key signs. (6) CNS‑depressant risk: Alcohol, opioids, and GHB compound sedation/ataxia and aspiration; TripSit’s combinations chart labels alcohol+DXM as dangerous and opioids+DXM as dangerous. (7) Stimulant combinations (amphetamines/cocaine) are unsafe due to cardiovascular load and agitation; TripSit flags these as unsafe. (8) Avoid ‘plateau sigma’ pursuit via serial redosing; the community and Effect Index summarize this technique as widely unpleasant and potentially dangerous; best practice is to avoid redosing during a session. (9) Bromide exposure from chronic heavy HBr salt intake can lead to bromism (neuropsychiatric symptoms, rash); Erowid discusses this risk and recommends avoiding prolonged high‑dose use. (10) Urine drug tests: DXM can trigger false‑positive PCP screens on immunoassays; confirmatory testing (GC/MS) resolves this. (11) Co‑ingredients specific risks: guaifenesin has been associated with renal complications at high doses; StatPearls describes AKI/stone risks for DXM+guaifenesin products. (12) Tolerance and spacing: High‑dose/frequent use rapidly builds tolerance and worsens adverse psychiatric outcomes; Erowid advises not more than once or twice per week; dissociative tolerance typically takes weeks to normalize. (13) Medical red flags: very high doses/overdose can present with agitation/psychosis, seizures, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and serotonin syndrome; StatPearls outlines clinical toxidrome and 3–30 h half‑life informing long observation windows.

Plan hydration, cooling breaks, and a clear comedown window. Idiosyncratically long effects are reported in a minority. [Evidence: Erowid MDA dosage/effects pages and duration review.] - Hydration and heat: To reduce hyperthermia/dehydration risk during dancing/heat, sip 300–500 mL non‑alcoholic, preferably isotonic fluids per hour and take regular cool‑down breaks. Avoid overhydration which can cause hyponatremia. [Evidence: Saferparty ‘Safer Use’ guidance; MDMA clinical toxicology reviews generalize to MDA.] - Redosing: Because MDA is long‑acting and tolerance rises acutely, redosing adds disproportionate toxicity (cardiovascular strain, overheating) with limited benefit; many services advise against it. [Evidence: Saferparty MDA page.] - Drug checking: MDA often co‑occurs with or is mis‑sold as MDMA; tablets and crystals may also contain synthesis by‑products. Use reagent kits and/or professional drug checking where available before use. [Evidence: Saferparty warnings; Erowid/DrugsData updates.] - Serotonin toxicity: Combining with MAOIs, DXM, or tramadol markedly raises serotonin syndrome risk; avoid. SSRIs/SNRIs usually dampen effects; however, stacking serotonergics increases cumulative load. [Evidence: TripSit combination guidance; MDMA toxicology reviews referencing MDA as a component.] - Temperature/setting: Stimulant‑psychedelic profile increases overheating and anxiety risk in crowded/hot venues; schedule rest, cooling, and quiet space. [Evidence: MDMA/entactogen toxicology, applied to closely related MDA.] - Tolerance/spacing: Frequent use is linked to more severe comedowns and mood dips. Community guidance suggests spacing experiences by at least several weeks to months. [Evidence: TripSit MDA harm‑reduction notes.] - Neurotoxicity: Animal literature indicates both MDMA and MDA can cause long‑lasting serotonergic changes; relative potency is debated. High ambient temperature and repeated/high dosing increase risk. Conservative dosing, spacing, and temperature management are prudent. [Evidence: Pharmacology reviews and animal studies summarized by Erowid; TripSit note that MDA may be more neurotoxic.] - Comedown care: Expect bruxism, jaw tension, sleep disruption, and low mood. Gentle stretching, magnesium for muscle tension (mixed evidence), nutrition, sleep hygiene, and avoiding alcohol can help recovery. [Evidence: Aggregated user reports and HR org advice.] - Pharmacokinetics uncertainty: Human half‑life data for MDA are sparse; effects can outlast expected timelines particularly with CYP2D6 inhibition or poor‑metabolizer status. Treat timing conservatively. [Evidence: DrugBank entry (lack of half‑life), MDMA CYP2D6 data extrapolated; stated as inference.] - Special populations: Cardiovascular disease, hepatic impairment, or seizure history increases risk; avoid. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers or those on CYP2D6 inhibitors may experience stronger/longer effects. [Evidence: MDMA toxicology/CYP2D6 role, extrapolated to MDA.]",

    "notes": "MXP is a diarylethylamine dissociative (diphenidine family), not an arylcyclohexylamine; conflating it with ketamine-like arylcyclohexylamines can mislead dosing expectations and risk assessment. Its effects can be slower to build than expected, making early redoses risky due to delayed peaks; many cases of over-intoxication follow stacking doses too closely. Several medical reports describe prolonged agitation, confusion, and need for sedation after high doses or polydrug use, underscoring its unpredictability compared with ketamine. Combining MXP with CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, sedatives) markedly increases risk of blackouts, aspiration, accidents, and respiratory complications even if dissociatives alone are not strong respiratory depressants. Stimulant combinations can worsen cardiovascular strain and agitation; serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs/SNRIs/MAOIs) may interact unpredictably because the diarylethylamine class has had mixed and incompletely characterized monoaminergic activity signals—err on the side of avoiding. Tolerance to dissociatives can build quickly with repeated use and shows cross-tolerance within the class, which tempts dose escalation and elevates harm. Chronic heavy dissociative use (well-documented with ketamine) is linked to urinary tract symptoms; specific MXP data are sparse, so prudent spacing and hydration are advisable to reduce potential urological stress. Because supply is unregulated, mislabeling and unexpected adulterants are common; using a reputable drug checking service (or at minimum reagent tests) before consumption reduces the risk of consuming the wrong drug or a dangerously potent adulterant. Non-medical IV use greatly elevates risk (unknown excipients, microbial contamination, local tissue injury, dosing overshoot); if someone nevertheless intends to inject, single-substance use, sterile technique, and micron filtration reduce but do not remove these risks. Strong set and setting effects are reported: high or chaotic doses can precipitate paranoia, delusions, or unsafe behavior; a sober sitter, safe environment, and avoiding hazards (roads, water, heights) meaningfully reduce accident risk. Accurate milligram measurement with a calibrated scale and volumetric dosing practices reduce accidental overdosing when working with variable-potency RC powders. Space sessions by at least 2–4 weeks to manage tolerance and reduce compulsive redosing patterns; consider pre-planning a cap on total session dose.",

Counterfeit risk: Drug-checking programs have repeatedly detected isotonitazepyne/protonitazepyne in fake “oxycodone/percocet” tablets; assume any non‑pharmacy tablet may contain nitazenes. Market alerts: EU drug monitoring reports document rising nitazene involvement in poisonings and widespread appearance in fake medicines across multiple EU countries. Test strips: Standard fentanyl test strips do not detect nitazenes; rely on lab drug checking or nitazene-specific methods where available. Onset and redosing: Some nitazenes show a short but sometimes delayed onset; wait at least 10–15 minutes after an insufflated test dose before any redose to reduce stacking risk. Overdose response: Expect profound respiratory depression; multiple 2–4 mg intranasal naloxone doses at 2–5 min intervals may be required, and recurrent sedation can occur—call emergency services and monitor continuously. Polysubstance risk: Benzodiazepines, alcohol, barbiturates, Z‑drugs, GHB/GBL and gabapentinoids synergistically worsen CNS/respiratory depression; avoid mixing. Adulterant co-exposures: In current markets, opioids are frequently combined with veterinary sedatives (xylazine, medetomidine) and/or benzodiazepines, further increasing overdose risk. Dosing method: Active in double‑digit micrograms—use volumetric dosing (e.g., dissolve a known amount into a measured volume, label clearly, and use an oral or nasal metered syringe) to avoid lethal error; avoid handling loose powder and prevent cross‑contamination. Naloxone access: Carry take‑home naloxone; many EU countries and local services now provide it—seek training. Avoid smoking/vaping: Pyrolysis behavior and delivered dose are unpredictable for nitazenes; inhalation can cause rapid overdose—safer routes remain those allowing measured dosing (e.g., diluted nasal sprays). [inference from general high‑potency opioid handling and drug‑checking cautions]. Do not use alone: Use with a trusted, naloxone‑trained person present and avoid using in isolation; consider supervised consumption where available. ",

    "notes": "Ephenidine is a selective NMDA receptor antagonist at the PCP site (Ki ≈ 66 nM) with modest activity at DAT/NET and sigma sites; this explains dissociation with a lightly stimulating edge in some users. Oral onset can be slow and sometimes delayed beyond 60 minutes, which increases the temptation to redose early—waiting a full 2 hours before any redose lowers the risk of overshooting. Residual stimulation, cognitive fog, and trouble sleeping can persist into the next day following strong doses; plan dosage timing accordingly (avoid late-evening starts if sleep is important). Compared with arylcyclohexylamines like ketamine, diarylethylamines have less defined data on urinary toxicity; nonetheless, users have reported bladder/urinary discomfort after heavy or frequent use—staying well-hydrated, spacing sessions widely, and stopping if urinary symptoms appear is prudent. Insufflation is frequently reported as harsh and irritating with a large chemical drip and shorter, less predictable effects; many users prefer oral or carefully prepared rectal solutions to reduce local irritation. Mixing with alcohol, GHB/GBL, or opioids markedly increases the risk of loss of consciousness, vomiting, and respiratory depression; these combinations account for many serious dissociative-related emergencies. Combining with stimulants increases heart rate and blood pressure and can precipitate anxious or manic states, particularly when sleep is missed. Dissociatives strongly impair balance and depth perception—set up a safe environment, avoid heights/water, and do not drive or cycle during or after use until fully baseline. Rapid, pronounced cross-tolerance exists across NMDA antagonists; frequent use quickly blunts effects and encourages dose escalation—spacing sessions by several weeks reduces risk. Community reagent-testing anecdotes suggest ephenidine may give an orange→brown Marquis and green Mandelin reaction; however, reagent kits cannot prove identity—use a professional drug checking service when possible.",

    "notes": "4,4′-DMAR is an aminorex derivative that EU authorities linked to clusters of deaths in 2013–2014 despite relatively limited prevalence; many cases involved polydrug use and/or mis-sold tablets marketed as ‘ecstasy’ or ‘speed’. A consistent theme in official alerts is a delayed onset (often ≥60–120 minutes), which likely contributed to redosing and hazardous combinations; therefore strict spacing of doses and avoidance of mixtures is critical. In vitro data show (±)-cis‑4,4′‑DMAR is a potent substrate-type releaser at DAT, NET, and especially SERT (DAT/SERT ≈2), implying a significant serotonergic component and elevating serotonin syndrome risk with SSRIs/SNRIs, MDMA, MAOIs, or other serotonergic agents. Reported adverse effects in fatalities and alerts include agitation, hyperthermia, respiratory problems, foaming at the mouth, and cardiac arrest; active cooling, hydration, and seeking urgent care for clonus, confusion, or high fever are essential if these occur. There are no human pharmacokinetic or formal toxicity studies, so half-life, active metabolites, and organ-specific risks remain uncertain; conservative dosing and avoiding repeat doses within the same day are prudent. As an aminorex-class stimulant, historical concerns with pulmonary hypertension were documented for aminorex/4‑MAR; while not established for 4,4′‑DMAR specifically, individuals with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease should avoid exposure. Multiple EU sources note mislabeling and street sales in tablet form with various logos; reagent tests may not distinguish all aminorex analogues, and only full-spectrum drug checking can confirm identity. Insufflation has been reported by users as harsh/caustic and may increase variability; oral administration is comparatively less erratic but still unpredictable. One EU case series recorded an injected exposure among fatalities; parenteral routes substantially elevate acute risk and are strongly discouraged. Because of the long duration and stimulating after-effects, plan for sleep hygiene and non-pharmacologic comedown strategies; using CNS depressants to force sleep can compound risk.",

Misrepresentation and cross‑contamination have been documented in the NPS market, and alpha‑PVP and 4‑FA have at times been sold as other stimulants; use reagent tests and, where available, GC/FTIR drug checking to reduce substitution risk. Typical oral sessions last about 4–5 hours with a 1–3 hour peak; short duration encourages redosing, which increases cardiovascular strain, hyperthermia, and insomnia risk. Intranasal use does not substantially improve bioavailability versus oral but adds local tissue damage; saline rinses after use reduce harm but oral ROA is safer on balance. Maintain hydration with small, regular electrolyte-containing fluids; avoid overhydration. Monitor temperature and take cool‑down breaks during physical activity or warm environments; escalating body heat, chest pain, severe headache, confusion, or persistent tachycardia warrant urgent medical assessment. Amphetamine-class drugs show large inter‑individual variability from CYP2D6 genotype and urine pH; acidic urine increases clearance while alkaline urine slows it, potentially prolonging effects. Combining with MAOIs or multiple stimulants significantly elevates risk of hypertensive crisis, arrhythmias, hyperthermia, and serotonin syndrome; this is a strict avoid. Tolerance builds rapidly with consecutive‑day use; spacing sessions by at least one to two weeks is a common community strategy to lower harm. Long‑term neurotoxicity of 2‑FA specifically has not been studied in humans; given the class risks (vasospasm, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis), conservative dosing and rest days are prudent.",

    "notes": "Bezitramide has a very slow oral onset (lag ~0.5–1 h; peak ~2.5–3.5 h) and a long apparent elimination half‑life (~11–24 h), which strongly increases the risk that users will redose before the first dose peaks; multiple early overdoses have occurred with this pattern. Its parent drug and active metabolite (R‑4618, often called despropionyl‑bezitramide) are primarily handled via gastrointestinal hydrolysis and biliary excretion, with <0.3% of a dose renally excreted unchanged; effects can therefore be prolonged and variable across individuals. Combining any opioid with other CNS depressants (benzodiazepines, alcohol, gabapentinoids, Z‑drugs) markedly increases risk of respiratory depression and serious outcomes; this is well documented at a population level. In overdose, naloxone will reverse respiratory depression but its duration (roughly 1–2 hours) is shorter than bezitramide’s, so repeated dosing or an IV infusion and prolonged observation (6–12 h or longer) may be required to prevent renarcotization. Because of poor water solubility and oral‑only design, non‑oral routes (e.g., injection, insufflation) are not advisable and may be ineffective/dangerous. Bezitramide was withdrawn from the Dutch market following fatal overdoses reported in 2004; legacy 5 mg tablets (Burgodin) represent a very high dose for opioid‑naïve persons and should not be used as a reference for safe non‑medical dosing. Tolerance to euphoric and analgesic effects can build quickly with repeated use, but tolerance to respiratory depression is incomplete; returning to previous doses after a break is a major overdose risk. Some opioids (notably meperidine, methadone, tramadol) have serotonergic liability; while direct evidence for bezitramide is limited, extra caution with serotonergic drugs is prudent. Always measure doses precisely (milligram scale or volumetric dosing) given sub‑mg to low‑mg activity reported anecdotally. Keep naloxone available and ensure others know to call emergency services, place in recovery position, and monitor breathing if sedation deepens after an initial reversal. ",

    "notes": "Coluracetam (MKC-231) is an experimental racetam-class compound with no approved medical indications; DrugBank lists it as an experimental small-molecule, and there is no established human safety dossier—treat cautiously and avoid daily long-term use without medical oversight. In animals with cholinergic damage, MKC-231 enhances high‑affinity choline uptake (HACU)—the rate‑limiting step in acetylcholine synthesis—by increasing CHT1 transporter availability at synaptic membranes; this mechanistic action underlies its nootropic interest but also implies additive effects with other cholinergic agents. Preclinical work shows procognitive effects after repeated dosing even when the drug is no longer detectable in brain at 24 h, which suggests short residence time with downstream transporter regulation; do not assume prolonged presence or redose prematurely. Human pharmacokinetics are not published; duration and onset figures come from community reports and aggregator timelines—expect variability and begin at the low end of dose ranges. Sublingual administration produces a faster onset and greater potency per mg than oral; because typical effective doses are in the single‑digit milligram range, use a calibrated milligram scale and avoid eyeballing powders—several users describe unpleasant visual/photophobic episodes after overdoing sublingual doses. Visual “HD/bright color” effects and mild photophobia have been reported anecdotally; avoid driving or hazardous tasks until you understand your response. Headache is commonly reported; while many users co‑dose dietary choline, remember that acetylcholine synthesis is constrained by choline transport capacity, so stacking multiple cholinergics (AChE inhibitors, high‑dose choline donors, nicotine) can tip into nausea, sweating, tremor or anxiety—back off and separate agents if this occurs. Because market products are unregulated, potency and purity vary; favor vendors with third‑party analyses and start with single‑agent trials before any stacks (other racetams, stimulants, or GABAergics). Many users report rapid tolerance or shifting effects with frequent use; spacing doses (e.g., 2–3 non‑consecutive days per week) is a common harm‑reduction practice. If you take prescription cholinergic therapies (e.g., for dementia or myasthenia) or have conditions sensitive to cholinergic tone, consult your clinician before any use; evidence in pregnancy/breastfeeding is absent—avoid.",

    "notes": "• Batch variability and mislabeling have been reported in the unregulated market, including cases where material sold as 3‑HO‑PCE behaved like an opioid (e.g., O‑DSMT). Use professional drug checking when possible; reagent kits will not reliably detect mislabeling and fentanyl strips do not detect O‑DSMT. Start with an allergy dose and avoid redosing until baseline pharmacology is clear. Community threads describe inconsistent potency and occasional opioid‑like effects when misidentified, underlining the need to test.\n• Volumetric dosing is strongly advised. Even at 10–40 mg active ranges, small scale errors can double the intended dose. TripSit guidance for potent arylcyclohexylamines recommends volumetric dosing and warns that onset can be delayed, so early redosing is a key cause of accidental overintoxication.\n• Avoid CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/BDO, high‑dose benzodiazepines). Dissociatives and depressants can synergize to cause vomiting with aspiration, loss of consciousness, and respiratory depression; TripSit flags these combinations as unsafe or dangerous across the class.\n• Allow long redose intervals (≥2 hours). Community reports consistently call 3‑HO‑PCE a ‘creeper’; premature redosing can suddenly stack effects into panic, delirium, or functional impairment.\n• Mood lability, hypomania/insomnia, and panic can occur—particularly with redosing, stimulant co‑use, or sleep deprivation. Plan set/setting, avoid driving or hazardous tasks during the experience and until fully baseline. Multiple first‑hand reports describe stimulating, psychiatric‑like headspaces and poor sleep if taken late.\n• Urinary risk: While specific human data for 3‑HO‑PCE are lacking, chronic/high‑frequency use of arylcyclohexylamines (e.g., ketamine) is linked to cystitis and bladder damage. Keep frequency moderate, maintain hydration, and stop if urinary symptoms (urgency, pain, blood) appear.\n• Drug testing: PCP immunoassays have poor specificity and cross‑react with several substances; ketamine can yield false‑positive PCP screens. ACHs may therefore trigger presumptive PCP positives; confirmation by GC/MS is definitive.\n• Metabolism/detection: In vitro HLM and user sample work identifies multiple phase‑I and O‑glucuronide metabolites for 3‑HO‑PCE. Targeted LC‑HRMS can detect M10 in urine and M5 in hair—useful if forensic confirmation is needed; routine immunoassays will not target these analytes.\n• Intranasal care: Finely crush material, use your own clean straw, alternate nostrils, and rinse with saline pre/post to reduce mucosal injury.\n• Tolerance rises rapidly across ACHs; spacing sessions by several weeks reduces escalation and adverse mental effects. Cross‑tolerance with ketamine/O‑PCE/PCP‑like compounds is expected.",

Insufflation is widely reported as irritating, with a bitter/chemical drip and unpredictable intensity; avoid large lines and consider oral use instead to reduce overdose risk. Vaporization/smoking produces an immediate, intense but brief peak; begin with 1–2 mg test puffs and use precise measurement or volumetric dosing to avoid overshooting. Combining with MAOIs significantly raises risk due to potentiation of tryptamines; avoid Syrian rue/ayahuasca or pharmaceutical MAOIs near 5-MeO-DALT sessions. As a serotonergic psychedelic, it can interact adversely with SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM, lithium, and other serotonergics; these combinations increase serotonin toxicity risk. Some users report headaches, chest tightness, and vasoconstriction; maintain gentle hydration and avoid hot environments and stimulant combinations. A minority report dysphoria, confusion, derealization, or panic; use in a safe setting with a sober sitter if inexperienced, and avoid if you have a personal/family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder. Test your sample (reagents, and where available GC/MS or FTIR drug checking) to rule out mislabeling/adulterants; ‘research chemical’ markets are inconsistent. Effects appear to exhibit cross-tolerance with other psychedelics; spacing sessions by at least 1–2 weeks helps restore sensitivity and reduces psychological strain. Avoid driving or hazardous activities until fully baseline, as perception and coordination may be altered beyond the subjective ‘come-down.’",

    "notes": "• Human data are sparse. Shulgin trialed 4–8.4 mg orally with onset at 12–60 min and total 2–4 h; he described mixed/ambiguous effects. Treat potency and individual variability with caution; start low and do not redose until you have fully assessed the first dose.\n• Accurate dosing matters: active in low milligrams. Use a 1 mg‑resolution scale and prefer volumetric dosing (e.g., dissolve a weighed amount to a known mg/mL). Avoid eyeballing crystals or “match‑head” measures. Erowid and TiHKAL emphasize low‑mg ranges in this family.\n• Route differences: vaping freebase starts within seconds and can overshoot easily; pre‑load measured doses and avoid back‑to‑back inhales. Vaped tryptamines are lung‑irritating; 5‑MeO‑DMT pages warn of respiratory harshness that generalizes to this class.\n• Interactions: 5‑MeO tryptamines interact unpredictably with MAOIs and can be dangerous; TripSit combination guidance flags 5‑MeO‑xxT + MAOI as high‑risk and cautions with stimulants and tramadol. Avoid serotonergic polypharmacy.\n• Serotonin‑toxicity mechanism inference: for 5‑MeO‑DMT, MAO‑A inhibition (e.g., harmaline) sharply increases systemic/brain levels; CYP2D6 status also alters bufotenine formation. While 5‑MeO‑DPT data are lacking, structural/biotransformation parallels argue for extra caution with MAOIs and CYP2D6 inhibitors.\n• Sensory profile: reports often mention a high‑pitched auditory tone or “bells,” body/jaw tension, anxious come‑ups, modest visuals at common doses, with more effects as dose increases. Shulgin explicitly noted alternating “bells” vs. “turn‑on” at 8.4 mg. Loud, complex audio environments can be unpleasant.\n• Storage and stability: like related 5‑MeO tryptamines, store airtight, cool, dry, and dark. Erowid’s 5‑MeO‑DiPT guide advises such storage; one BlueLight report suspected degradation in a room‑temperature solution—avoid long‑term liquid storage.\n• Product uncertainty: 5‑MeO‑DPT has appeared sporadically on the NPS market. Mislabeling in this space is common (e.g., 5‑MeO‑DMT sold as DMT); only lab methods like GC‑MS/HR‑LC‑MS can reliably distinguish isomeric 5‑MeO tryptamines. Use accredited drug‑checking services where available.\n• Re‑dosing discipline: wait at least 90–120 min after an oral dose (or 20–30 min after a vaped dose) before considering more; several reports describe anxiety spikes during the first 20–40 min that resolve without escalation.\n• Tolerance: cross‑tolerance with serotonergic psychedelics is expected; TripSit and community sources recommend multi‑day spacing. Heavy or consecutive‑day use can dull effects and increase adverse somatic load.\n• Managing body/jaw tension: some users find pre‑event magnesium supplementation, hydration, and chewing gum reduce bruxism; evidence is anecdotal and inconsistent—avoid mega‑doses and consider a mouthguard if prone to grinding.\n• Lab vs. reagent tests: common color reagents cannot distinguish 5‑MeO isomers; professional GC‑MS/LC‑MS with robust libraries is needed for confirmation and for detecting adulterants.

    "notes": "• Potency varies widely; Erowid and TIHKAL document active effects in some people at 1–2 mg orally, while others need higher doses. Because 5‑MeO‑MiPT has a steep response curve and sub‑10 mg dosing, use a calibrated milligram scale and consider volumetric dosing to avoid accidental multi‑x overdoses. • Duration commonly spans 4–7 hours orally with an early body‑energized onset and residual stimulation that can delay sleep; some users report insomnia for several hours after baseline. Plan set/setting accordingly and avoid redosing to sleep. • Prominent body effects include anxious stimulation, muscle tension, tremor, and GI upset (gas/diarrhea/cramps); rare reports describe uncomfortable vasoconstriction—people with cardiovascular disease should be cautious and start low. Hydrate regularly, especially if dancing or in warm environments. • Interactions: combining with MAOIs can sharply increase serotonergic exposure (and caused strong potentiation with related tryptamines); avoid this combination. Stacking with stimulants or MDMA raises cardiovascular and anxiety risks; tramadol/DXM add serotonergic and seizure risk. If a calming agent is needed, use a single, known‑dose benzodiazepine cautiously and never with alcohol. • Identity/adulteration risks exist in the RC market; mislabeling as other compounds (e.g., stimulants) has been reported. Use reagent tests as a first pass (Ehrlich positive for indoles; Mecke/Mandelin often red‑brown/yellow‑brown for 5‑MeO tryptamines) and prioritize lab testing where available. Do not assume blotters/pills are correctly labeled. • Salt vs freebase: the HCl (or fumarate) salt is water‑soluble; freebase is poorly water‑soluble and intended for vaporization. If material won’t dissolve in water, it may be freebase or misidentified—do not force oral use; converting freebase to a salt requires proper acid/base handling. • Smoking/vaporizing uses larger masses than oral and produces an immediate rush followed by hours of trippiness; because data are limited and the inhaled route can feel more anxious/harsh, titrate very conservatively. Avoid open flame and overheating to limit degradation. • Tolerance rises acutely and typically diminishes over several days; spacing sessions by at least 5–7 days reduces attenuation and helps integration. Cross‑tolerance with classical psychedelics is likely. • Individuals with seizure histories, serious heart disease, or a family history of psychosis should be especially cautious; psychedelics can unmask latent vulnerabilities. Avoid driving or hazardous tasks during and after use due to impairments in attention, coordination, and visual processing. • Sexual/tactile enhancement is common but can encourage redosing; keep doses modest, maintain hydration/electrolytes, and communicate about consent as judgment can fluctuate under entactogenic effects.

    "notes": "1) Urinary pH strongly alters amphetamine clearance: alkaline urine markedly prolongs half-life (reports up to ~34 h) while acidic urine increases excretion. Intentionally alkalinizing (e.g., baking soda/antacids) can amplify and prolong effects unpredictably and raises cardiovascular and insomnia risks. Do not attempt; if taken inadvertently with antacids, lower redose plans and extend spacing. 2) Combining with MAOIs is contraindicated (hypertensive crisis/serotonin toxicity). A strict 14‑day washout from MAOIs is standard. 3) Serotonergic co‑use (SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs, tramadol, DXM, some psychedelics) increases serotonin syndrome risk; warn, avoid, or use only with medical oversight if prescribed agents are involved. 4) Other stimulants (cocaine, methamphetamine, cathinones) additively increase heart rate, BP, and hyperthermia risks; such combos are a common context for rhabdomyolysis and acute complications—avoid. 5) Heat/exertion: plan active cooling and hydration. For hot venues or dancing, sip 250–500 mL/h fluid, preferably isotonic; take cooling breaks. Avoid overhydration by using electrolytes; aim for steady light sweating and clear, not excessive, urine. 6) Insufflation of tablets: binders/dyes and talc irritate nasal mucosa and may reach lungs; if one insists, use micro‑lines, alternate nostrils, and rinse with sterile saline before/after. Persistent bleeding, congestion, foul smell, or septal pain warrant cessation and medical assessment. XR beads are especially harsh intranasally and are best swallowed; crushing XR defeats time‑release and tends to cause a sharp, short peak with more comedown. 7) CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, quinidine, dronedarone) can raise levels and adverse effects; dose conservatively and avoid stacking with other stimulants. 8) Cardiovascular screening is prudent if history suggests risk (syncope, chest pain, arrhythmia, structural disease, family history). Avoid self‑treating stimulant‑induced hypertension with nonselective beta‑blockers; in emergencies, benzodiazepines and external cooling are first‑line while antihypertensives (e.g., nicardipine/labetalol) are clinician‑directed. 9) Redosing within a few hours produces diminishing euphoria and more side‑effects; set a cap and spacing window before starting. Multi‑day runs dramatically increase psychosis, sleep deprivation, and mood crash risk—plan ≥4 weeks off between binges. 10) Warning signs needing urgent care include severe chest pain, confusion/psychosis, hyperthermia (>40.5°C), muscle rigidity, dark urine (possible rhabdomyolysis), or uncontrollable agitation; early sedation and rapid cooling by professionals are standard in life‑threatening presentations. 11) Nutrition/dentition: stimulants suppress appetite and cause bruxism; plan small calorie‑dense meals/shakes and chew gum to reduce jaw clenching; refeed and sleep after use. 12) Prefer oral route over snorting or injection for pharmaceutical tablets to minimize tissue injury and excipient harms; never inject crushed tablets without appropriate filtration (high risk of emboli/infection).",

    "notes": "1) Codeine’s potency is highly variable due to CYP2D6 genetics: ultrarapid metabolizers convert more codeine to morphine and can experience life‑threatening respiratory depression at ‘normal’ doses, while poor metabolizers may feel little effect; start low, avoid dose-stacking, and be especially cautious if you or relatives have had unusual reactions to codeine or tramadol. Breastfeeding parents who are ultrarapid metabolizers have caused fatal infant opioid toxicity; avoid codeine if pregnant or breastfeeding. (NCBI Medical Genetics Summaries – Codeine/CYP2D6.) 2) Schedule V codeine cough syrups are limited to ≤200 mg/100 mL (≤2 mg/mL), and common promethazine/codeine products are 10 mg codeine + 6.25 mg promethazine per 5 mL; translate culture ‘pour’ sizes into milligrams to reduce accidental overdosing: 1 oz (30 mL) ≈ 60 mg codeine; 2 oz ≈ 120 mg; 3 oz ≈ 180 mg. (NCBI Medical Genetics Summaries; Drugs‑Forum community dosing labels; multiple Reddit threads corroborating 10 mg/5 mL.) 3) Promethazine is a strong CNS depressant with anticholinergic and antidopaminergic effects; it adds to opioid sedation and can cause confusion, disorientation, urinary retention, constipation, blurred vision, and (rarely) dystonia or seizures. Its long half‑life (∼10–19 h) means ‘hangover’ drowsiness and impairment can last into the next day—do not drive or operate machinery. (NCBI StatPearls – Promethazine.) 4) Combining any opioid (including codeine) with benzodiazepines, alcohol, gabapentinoids, Z‑drugs, barbiturates, or GHB markedly increases risk of fatal respiratory depression; promethazine further intensifies sedation. If polydrug use has occurred and breathing is slow or shallow, call emergency services and administer naloxone if available—be aware promethazine sedation may persist after naloxone reverses the opioid component. (TripSit combo guidance; DrugWise overdose harm‑reduction.) 5) Avoid stacking additional first‑generation antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine/doxylamine): they are also CNS depressants and diphenhydramine inhibits CYP2D6, which can unpredictably blunt euphoria yet increase sedation and risk. (TripSit codeine page.) 6) Some prescriptions are ‘VC’ formulations that include a decongestant (often phenylephrine); these can raise blood pressure and heart rate and are poor candidates for recreational dosing—always read the exact label. (Drugs‑Forum community threads discussing Phenergan VC with Codeine.) 7) Counterfeit or ‘homebrew’ lean may contain unknown opioids, benzodiazepines, or other sedatives; effects can mimic genuine products but potency and contents are unpredictable. Use only clearly labeled pharmacy products; if exposed to unknown syrups, start with very small test doses and avoid any other depressants. (Numerous community reports on Reddit lean forums.) 8) Never inject codeine syrups or attempt to filter for injection: codeine IV can cause pulmonary edema and severe reactions, and syrups contain excipients unsafe for injection. (Erowid Opioid FAQ.) 9) Opioids slow gut motility—constipation, nausea, and urinary retention are common; hydration, fiber, and planned bowel regimens reduce harm. Seek medical help for severe abdominal pain or no bowel movement for several days. 10) People with sleep apnea, chronic lung disease, obesity hypoventilation, or the very young/elderly are at higher risk of respiratory depression; promethazine carries a boxed warning for fatal respiratory depression in children under two—avoid in children and use extreme caution in adolescents.

    "notes": "• Microgram potency; never eyeball. Use a 0.001 g (or better) scale and volumetric dosing. NBOMe powders are too potent for typical scales; uneven blotter loading is commonly reported.\n• Do not assume oral inactivity. For NBOMes, oral bioavailability can be unreliable rather than absent; delayed effects have led to hazardous redosing. Prefer buccal administration if using at all.\n• Strong peripheral vasoconstriction and sympathomimetic toxicity have been repeatedly reported with NBOMes (tachycardia, hypertension, cold or numb extremities). Risk increases steeply ≥1 mg.\n• Misrepresentation on LSD-style blotter is common; NBOMe tabs are typically bitter/metallic and can numb the mouth. Test blotters: Ehrlich/Hofmann positive suggests lysergamide; NBOMes do not react with Ehrlich and show distinct Marquis reactions.\n• Avoid combinations with stimulants, MAOIs, DXM, or tramadol. These increase risks of hypertension, hyperthermia, seizures, and serotonin toxicity.\n• Re-dosing strongly increases unpredictability, body-load, and adverse events; wait at least 3 h before concluding inactivity when identity is uncertain.\n• Severe agitation, seizures, or hyperthermia require urgent medical care. First-line in hospital is supportive care with benzodiazepines and cooling; mention suspected NBOMe to clinicians.\n• Nasal dosing increases speed of onset and adverse body-load; irritation and pronounced vasoconstriction are common. Avoid dry powder insufflation.\n• Keep the environment cool, avoid prolonged physical exertion, and sip fluids with electrolytes to mitigate hyperthermia risk; do not overhydrate.\n• People with cardiovascular disease, Raynaud’s phenomenon, or seizure history should avoid the NBOMe class entirely due to elevated risk.\n• Distinguish from LSD: LSD blotter is typically nearly tasteless and fluoresces under UV; NBOMe blotters are often bitter/metallic and may not fluoresce. Always rely on reagents/drug checking, not taste alone.",

    "notes": "Human data are sparse; treat MGM‑15 as a novel, variably potent opioid. Mislabeling/adulteration is possible in grey markets; fentanyl test strips do not detect most non‑fentanyl opioids and a “negative” result does not confirm identity—use trusted suppliers and, where available, GC/MS drug checking. Start with an allergy test (1–2 mg) and titrate slowly using a 0.001 g scale or volumetric dosing; avoid stacking doses during the rise. Insufflation is discouraged due to abrupt onset and greater overdose risk; oral or sublingual are lower‑risk. Carry naloxone (e.g., 4 mg intranasal) and have a sober person present; repeat every 2–3 min if no response and seek emergency help because re‑narcotization can occur as naloxone (30–90 min) may wear off before MGM‑15. Avoid mixing with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, gabapentinoids, GHB); most fatal overdoses involve such combinations. People with sleep apnea, COPD/asthma, severe obesity, hepatic/renal impairment, or on sedating psych meds have elevated respiratory risk; lower starting doses and medical consultation are prudent. Opioid‑induced constipation is common—hydrate, increase dietary fiber gradually, and consider prophylactic osmotic laxatives (PEG 3350) rather than relying on stool softeners alone. Histamine‑related itching/flushing may occur; if using an antihistamine choose the least sedating option and lower the MGM‑15 dose. Do not drive or operate machinery for at least the rest of the day after moderate/strong doses; residual impairment can persist into the next morning. Daily use rapidly builds tolerance and dependence; schedule days off and taper slowly when discontinuing (e.g., −5–10% every 5–7 days) to reduce withdrawal (yawning, rhinorrhea, mydriasis, GI upset, insomnia, restless legs). Immunoassay urine “opiate” screens may or may not detect MGM‑15; confirmatory LC‑MS/MS can. Store securely in child‑resistant packaging; a single strong dose can be life‑threatening to opioid‑naïve persons or pets.",

Start with a partial tab if untested. Wait up to 3 hours before considering any redose because delayed-onset adulterants sometimes appear on blotter. Use professional drug checking when available; many services accept blotter pieces.\n• Reagent testing: Ehrlich (p‑DMAB) turns violet with indole lysergamides (LSD, 1B‑LSD). NBOMe/NBOH phenethylamines do not give this reaction, so a negative Ehrlich is a red flag for non‑lysergamide blotters.\n• Avoid lithium entirely with psychedelics; numerous case reports and user accounts describe seizures and severe adverse reactions when combined.\n• Avoid tramadol and be cautious with other seizure‑threshold–lowering medicines (e.g., bupropion); combine only under medical oversight.\n• Combining with potent stimulants (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine) increases tachycardia, blood pressure, anxiety, and risk of panic or manic states.\n• Cannabis frequently potentiates visual and cognitive effects; it also increases the chance of anxiety and confusion during come‑up and peak.\n• Set and setting matter: use in a safe, familiar environment with a trusted sober sitter if inexperienced. Postpone if feeling unwell or unstable.\n• Storage: like LSD, 1B‑LSD on blotter is degraded by heat, light, oxygen, and moisture. Best practice is foil wrap, airtight container with desiccant, stored cold and dark (freezer).\n• Tolerance rises rapidly after a single dose and can make redoses during the same or next day unpredictably weak while increasing side‑effects. Allow at least ~2 weeks to return to baseline.\n• As an N‑acyl lysergamide, 1B‑LSD is widely considered a prodrug of LSD. Treat unknown or novel analogs with the same caution as LSD, assuming full psychedelic potency and duration.",

Purity and identity are major risks in this market; drug checking services repeatedly find mislabelled or mixed cathinones—do not assume a product sold as ‘MEC’ contains a single compound. Reagent kits have limitations; laboratory GC/MS‑based checking is the gold standard. As with other stimulants/empathogens, hyperthermia and sodium imbalance are key preventable harms: sip electrolytes instead of excess plain water, take cooling breaks, and watch for confusion, headache, or nausea consistent with hyponatraemia. Strong vasoconstriction and tachycardia occur with related cathinones; cold or blue fingertips indicate reduced peripheral blood flow—stop use, rehydrate, warm, and seek care if persistent. Intranasal use increases local vasoconstriction and mucosal injury; alternate nostrils, avoid frequent re‑dosing, and rinse with sterile saline after sessions. Urge‑to‑redose is common; set firm pre‑measured doses and maximum session totals, allow sleep and nutrition, and space sessions by at least 1–2 weeks to reduce mood crash and tolerance. Avoid self‑medicating stimulant side‑effects with random cardio‑active medicines; if chest pain, severe headache, confusion, or overheating occurs, seek emergency medical care—clinicians typically manage severe stimulant toxicity with supportive measures and benzodiazepines.",

Cathinone itself is scheduled in multiple jurisdictions (e.g., US Schedule I), so materials that actually are the parent cathinone carry significant legal risk. Assume typical cathinone stimulant risks: tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction, hyperthermia, anxiety, insomnia, and a strong urge to redose—avoid consecutive-day or continuous use. For oral use, wait at least 2 hours before considering any redose to avoid stacking. Hydrate with electrolytes (not only water) and take cooling breaks in hot or crowded settings to reduce hyperthermia risk; do not overhydrate due to hyponatremia risk. Insufflation commonly causes marked nasal irritation; mitigate by using fine powders, alternating nostrils, and rinsing with sterile saline after sessions; avoid oxymetazoline longer than 3 days due to rebound congestion. Avoid combining with MAOIs (including harmala alkaloids) due to hypertensive crisis risk, and avoid combining with bupropion or tramadol because of additive seizure risk. Stimulant markets frequently show mislabeling/adulteration (e.g., samples sold as one cathinone containing different cathinones or, in stimulant markets, unexpected benzodiazepines/nitazenes), so drug checking is strongly recommended before use. People with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or a history of seizures should avoid use; seek medical evaluation if chest pain, severe headache, hyperthermia, confusion, or persistent agitation occur.",

    "notes": "HARM REDUCTION JUSTIFICATION FOR EACH ADDITION/CHANGE (sources cited): 1) Extreme potency and microgram-per‑kilogram dosing mean small errors can be lethal; boxed warnings note profound respiratory depression, especially with CNS depressants. Only trained teams with airway/ventilation backup should administer alfentanil. This underpins the emphasis on microgram units and non‑promotion of non‑medical routes. (NCBI StatPearls: Alfentanil; FDA‑style warnings summarized in StatPearls.) 2) Rapid IV boluses of potent fentanyl‑class opioids can cause chest wall rigidity (“wooden chest”), complicating ventilation; avoidance of rapid push and readiness for neuromuscular blockade are standard precautions. (NCBI anesthesia/WHO monograph content on opioid‑induced rigidity; StatPearls anesthesia topics.) 3) Overdose reversal often requires repeated or higher cumulative naloxone doses with high‑potency synthetic opioids; naloxone’s effect may wane before the opioid, necessitating monitoring and possible infusion. This supports guidance to expect multiple naloxone doses and prolonged observation. (NCBI StatPearls: Opioid Toxicity; Naloxone.) 4) Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, azoles, macrolides) significantly increase alfentanil exposure; inducers reduce it. Grapefruit is a dietary CYP3A4 inhibitor. This justifies flagging both inhibitor and inducer classes and grapefruit. (NCBI clinical interaction tables; DrugBank and StatPearls noting CYP3A4 metabolism.) 5) Co‑use with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants greatly raises fatality risk; this is an FDA boxed warning echoed in StatPearls. (NCBI StatPearls: Alfentanil.) 6) Gabapentinoid–opioid combinations raise overdose risk; observational studies show increased odds of opioid‑related death vs opioids alone, supporting the “unsafe” designation. (AHRQ/NCBI evidence review; StatPearls: Pregabalin.) 7) Some opioids, including fentanyl‑class agents, have serotonergic properties; combined with serotonergic drugs they can contribute (rarely) to serotonin syndrome. This warrants a caution flag rather than absolute contraindication outside MAOIs. (NCBI StatPearls: Opioid Analgesics; Serotonin Syndrome.) 8) Unregulated opioid supplies commonly contain multiple high‑potency opioids plus benzodiazepine‑related drugs and/or xylazine; naloxone will not reverse non‑opioids. Drug checking programs document such combinations, justifying advice to expect complex overdoses and the need for rescue breathing even after naloxone. (Toronto Drug Checking Service reports.) 9) Pharmacokinetics: short half‑life (~1.5–1.8 h), high protein binding, and CYP3A4 metabolism mean rapid onset/offset but variable free levels in acute illness; this supports caution about redosing and about conditions altering α1‑acid glycoprotein. (NCBI StatPearls: Alfentanil; DrugBank-cited AAG binding study.) 10) Because naloxone’s duration can be shorter than some opioids, observation is still required after apparent reversal; although alfentanil is short‑acting, polysubstance exposures extend risk. (NCBI StatPearls: Opioid Toxicity; Naloxone.) 11) MAOIs pose well‑known hazards with several opioids (and are contraindicated in many opioid monographs), hence placement in “dangerous.” (NCBI StatPearls: MAOIs; opioid references.) 12) Alternative names added from MeSH to aid cross‑reference with labels and literature.

Oral dosing is generally less locally harmful.\n- Rectal dosing increases efficiency and can intensify effects; dissolve in a small volume of clean water, use lubrication, and avoid sharp applicators to reduce mucosal injury.\n- Sleep disruption and residual stimulation are common; plan dosing to allow a full night’s sleep and avoid multi-day binges, which raise risks of paranoia and psychosis.\n- Hydration: sip fluids regularly and do not overconsume water; aim for small, steady intake and include electrolytes during prolonged activity to avoid hyponatremia.\n- Reagent testing can help verify stimulant presence: with Marquis, amphetamines typically show yellow–orange to brown reactions; use multiple reagents and consider lab drug checking where available.\n- People with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, arrhythmias, or significant anxiety disorders should avoid use; these conditions increase the likelihood of adverse events with stimulants.\n- Bruxism and jaw clenching are common; gum or a soft mouthguard can reduce dental strain.\n- Because pharmacokinetics are uncharacterized in humans, avoid stacking doses; allow at least 4–6 hours between small test doses to assess duration and intensity before considering any redose.",

Reference interaction charts and clinical case overviews.\n• Overheating and over‑hydration are both documented risks with MDMA‑like stimulants: take cooling breaks, don’t over‑exert, sip ~250–500 mL fluids per hour in hot/dancing conditions, and include electrolytes to reduce hyponatremia risk.\n• Identity verification: reagent tests for 5‑EAPB can mimic MDMA/5‑APB/6‑APB reactions (dark/black on Marquis/Mecke). Lab testing is preferable where available; recent market reports show frequent 5‑APB / 6‑APB mislabeling.\n• Dose conservatively and account for salt form; many samples are HCl. Avoid stacking redoses—subjective returns diminish while adverse effects accumulate. Reference doses are from user communities and should not be treated as guaranteed safe.\n• Insufflation tends to increase acute side‑effects (irritation, tachycardia) and shorten duration; oral routes are generally more predictable based on community data.\n• Serious toxicities and at least one suspected death have been flagged by European early‑warning networks for closely related benzofurans, including alerts naming 5‑EAPB; ultra‑high doses (hundreds of mg) are dangerous.\n• Spacing: as with MDMA‑like releasers, allow several weeks between sessions to reduce tolerance and mood disturbances; frequent use is associated with prolonged insomnia and mood dips in reports.

    "notes": "Peer-reviewed or authoritative human pharmacology for 4F‑PPP is essentially absent; most risk guidance must be inferred from the α‑PPP/MPPP/α‑PVP pyrrolidinophenone family and user reports. Pyrrolidinophenones are strongly associated with compulsive re-dosing, insomnia, paranoia and psychosis on binges; plan strict limits and time boundaries to reduce harm. Cardio‑stimulation (tachycardia, hypertension) and vasoconstriction are expected; those with cardiovascular or anxiety disorders should avoid. Intranasal use is often highly caustic across this class and causes notable nasal irritation and congestion; oral or other non‑nasal routes may reduce, but not eliminate, local harm. Because mislabeling/substitution is common in stimulant RC markets, reagent testing and, where available, full drug checking is strongly recommended before dose decisions; assume your product may not be the claimed molecule. Avoid combining with MAOIs—dangerous hypertensive reactions can occur with stimulants; avoid stacking with other stimulants to reduce cardiac and seizure risks. Tramadol and bupropion lower seizure threshold and can interact poorly with stimulants; avoid or use only under medical advice with strict dose limits. If sleep is delayed, prioritize hydration, food, and sleep hygiene rather than further dosing; use benzodiazepines only if medically appropriate and never with alcohol due to additive respiratory depression. Tolerance and crash can encourage frequent re-dosing; scheduling breaks of multiple weeks reduces risk of dependence patterns seen with α‑PVP‑like stimulants. Absence of verified half‑life and active metabolite data means delayed interactions or prolonged stimulation are possible—leave extra time before re-dosing or mixing. Start with an allergy test and weigh doses precisely; volumetric dosing helps avoid scale error at low milligram amounts.",

    "notes": "Propranolol is a non-selective beta-1/beta-2 blocker used for cardiovascular indications, migraine prophylaxis, essential tremor, thyrotoxicosis, infantile hemangioma, and off-label for performance anxiety. It is contraindicated in asthma/COPD and in patients with baseline bradycardia or higher-degree heart block due to risk of bronchospasm and conduction block. It can exacerbate peripheral vasospasm and is generally avoided in vasospastic (Prinzmetal) angina. In diabetes, propranolol may blunt adrenergic warning signs of hypoglycemia (e.g., tremor, palpitations), so glucose monitoring and education are essential. During acute cocaine toxicity, non-selective beta-blockers are generally avoided because of potential unopposed alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction; tachycardia and hypertension should be managed with alternatives per emergency protocols. In known or suspected pheochromocytoma, do not start beta-blockade until adequate alpha-blockade is established; otherwise severe hypertension can occur. Combining propranolol with potent AV-nodal–blocking drugs (verapamil, diltiazem; digoxin; amiodarone) substantially increases risks of bradycardia, heart block, and hypotension; if used, it requires close monitoring and is often avoided. Propranolol can reduce responsiveness to epinephrine in anaphylaxis; this does not contraindicate epinephrine, but emergency teams may give glucagon as an adjunct if refractory. Abrupt discontinuation after chronic use can precipitate rebound tachycardia, angina, or myocardial infarction; taper gradually with prescriber guidance. Overdose can cause profound bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, seizures, and wide QRS from sodium-channel blockade; emergency care may involve glucagon, high-dose insulin-euglycemia therapy, vasopressors, sodium bicarbonate for QRS widening, and lipid emulsion in refractory cases. IV propranolol should only be used with continuous ECG and blood-pressure monitoring; non-medical IV use is hazardous. Lipophilicity means CNS effects (fatigue, sleep disturbance, vivid dreams/nightmares) are more likely than with hydrophilic beta-blockers; mood changes and depressive symptoms are reported but causality is mixed. Hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 inhibitors can raise levels; start low and titrate cautiously. During breastfeeding, transfer into milk is low and adverse infant effects are unlikely; this is considered compatible with lactation. Food increases oral bioavailability; dose timing consistency helps avoid variability in effect.",

    "notes": "— Justification: Potency and batch variability. Multiple user reports show widely different active doses (from ~50 mg doing little to 150–200 mg being ‘functional/euphoric’) and some batches likely mislabelled or degraded; therefore allergy testing and slow titration are essential. Reagent testing (e.g., Marquis) may show no reaction for aminorex analogues, so a ‘negative’ test does not confirm identity; lab drug checking (GC/LC‑MS) is preferred.\n— Justification: Serotonergic interaction risk. Classic aminorex is a serotonin transporter substrate; combining SERT‑active stimulants or MAOIs raises serotonin syndrome risk. TripSit lists MAOIs and serotonergic combinations with stimulants/DXM/tramadol as dangerous. Avoid these combinations with 4C‑MAR unless under medical supervision.\n— Justification: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) signal for the aminorex class. Aminorex use in 1960s Europe was linked to a marked increase in primary pulmonary hypertension; modern summaries still list aminorex among drug causes of PAH. Frequency and translatability to 4C‑MAR are unknown, but anyone with cardiac/pulmonary risk factors should avoid repeated/frequent use and seek care for unexplained dyspnea, chest pain, near‑syncope, or edema.\n— Justification: Potential neurotoxicity concerns by analogy. Para‑chloro substituted phenethylamines (e.g., p‑chloroamphetamine) produce serotonergic neurotoxicity in animals; 4C‑MAR is structurally different (aminorex vs. phenethylamine), so this is an inference rather than a proven risk, but it supports minimizing dose/frequency.\n— Justification: Hyperthermia/vasoconstriction and cardiovascular strain are core stimulant risks. Maintain normal hydration (not excessive), take cooling breaks, and avoid stacking stimulants. TripSit stimulant pages document tachycardia, hypertension and peripheral vasoconstriction as typical; users of related halogenated aminorexes also report long wakefulness, jaw tension and big pupils.\n— Justification: Long duration and insomnia. 4‑MAR has 10–16 h primary effects with long after‑effects; user reports for 4C‑MAR/4F‑MAR describe 12–20+ h of stimulation or wakefulness, so plan dose timing to avoid sleep loss and avoid redosing late in the day.\n— Justification: ROA‑specific cautions. Users describe large hard crystals; insufflation can be irritating and promotes compulsive redosing. Oral dosing has a slower onset but is easier to titrate and may reduce nasal injury; always begin with an allergy test (≤1–5 mg) and increase in small steps using accurate scales/volumetric methods.\n— Justification: Testing limitations and misidentification. Aminorex analogues may show little/no reaction with Marquis; therefore a combination of multiple reagents plus access to community drug‑checking services is advised when possible.\n— Justification: Space use to limit tolerance and harm. General stimulant guidance recommends substantial breaks between sessions; frequent multi‑day runs accelerate tolerance and sleep/cardiovascular strain. ",

    "notes": "Fenfluramine’s active metabolite norfenfluramine is a potent 5‑HT2B receptor agonist; 5‑HT2B activation on cardiac valvular interstitial cells is strongly linked to valvular fibroplasia and regurgitation, the mechanistic basis for Fen‑Phen–associated valvular heart disease (VHD). Daily or prolonged courses markedly increase risk; there is no known completely safe exposure threshold. Modern fenfluramine use (for Dravet/LGS) mandates baseline and periodic echocardiograms due to risks of VHD and pulmonary arterial hypertension—illustrating that repeated exposure warrants cardiac surveillance. Phentermine contributes sympathomimetic effects (NE ≫ DA) and can precipitate hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, anxiety, and insomnia; acute stimulant toxicity is managed with benzodiazepines first‑line, avoiding β‑blocker monotherapy. Fenfluramine is metabolized by multiple CYPs (1A2, 2B6, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4); potent inhibitors (e.g., quinidine for CYP2D6, fluvoxamine for CYP1A2) can increase fenfluramine/norfenfluramine levels. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers show reduced dexfenfluramine clearance in vitro; clinical exposures can vary. Combining with serotonergic agents (SSRIs/SNRIs/MAOIs/MDMA/DXM/tramadol/meperidine/linezolid) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome; onset can be rapid after dose or medication changes. Due to long half‑lives (~20 h each), avoid redosing within 24–48 h; accumulation increases cardiovascular and serotonergic risks. Avoid use in pregnancy, uncontrolled hypertension, coronary disease, valvular disease, pulmonary hypertension, glaucoma, or hyperthyroidism. Hydration, temperature awareness, and nutrition are essential: anorexia, exertion, and insomnia increase dehydration and hyperthermia risk. Drug checking cannot confirm fenfluramine with standard reagents; misrepresentation/substitution is plausible—exercise extra caution.",

Evidence from mephedrone health reports and DrugWise summaries. 2) Serotonergic mixes (MDMA, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol, DXM, linezolid/MAOIs) can precipitate serotonin syndrome; this is a well-characterised interaction pattern in clinical guidance. 3) In acute stimulant toxicity, pure β-blockade is controversial due to possible unopposed α-agonism; first-line clinical management emphasises benzodiazepines and supportive care—hence the caution against self-medicating with β-blockers. 4) Hyponatremia has been documented with entactogenic cathinones in some cases; sip small amounts of electrolyte-containing fluids rather than overhydrating, especially if sweating heavily. 5) Insufflation of cathinones is caustic and linked to nasal pain/bleeding; oral dosing is generally lower-harm if one chooses to proceed. 6) Compulsive redosing and all-night wakefulness are common across NEB/NEP-type stimulants; plan a firm dose ceiling, avoid keeping the bag within reach, and pre-schedule sleep recovery. 7) Market volatility: EU monitoring shows rapid shifts in cathinone supply and frequent identification of new analogues; drug checking services and reagent tests can reduce uncertainty, but reagents are suggestive only and some cathinones yield weak/ambiguous color changes (e.g., faint Marquis yellow; slow Simon’s to blue). 8) Injecting synthetic cathinones has been associated with outbreaks of infections (including HIV) and severe local harms; avoid IV use. 9) Because human pharmacokinetics for 4‑Me‑NEB are unknown, conservative titration and extended spacing between trials are essential.

    "notes": "Human data for 2C‑iP are extremely limited; most guidance comes from a handful of forum reports and a single curated trip report, so conservative dosing and careful titration are essential. Onsets around 2–3 hours have been reported for oral use, which increases the risk of accidental overdosing via early redosing—wait several hours before considering any additional dose. Long total durations of 12–16+ hours have been described at common to strong doses; plan set, setting, and sleep accordingly. Phenethylamine psychedelics in the 2C‑x family commonly produce mental and physical stimulation; monitor heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and hydration, especially if physically exerting or in hot environments. Insufflation of 2C‑x compounds is widely reported to be painful and irritating to the nasal mucosa and may increase nausea on come‑up; oral routes are generally more tolerable for many. An effect‑indexed 50 mg oral report flagged possible urinary/bladder discomfort during/after the experience—frequency and mechanism are unknown; if burning, difficulty urinating, or flank pain occur, hydrate, avoid further dosing, and seek medical care if severe. Because 2C‑iP is rare in the market, mislabeling or substitution is plausible; use reagent tests and, where available, lab drug checking—do not assume a 2C‑B pill/powder contains 2C‑B or any 2C at all. If a difficult experience develops, reduce sensory load, hydrate, and consider a low, measured benzodiazepine dose only if necessary; avoid alcohol and additional stimulants. Cross‑tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics is expected; spacing trips by at least 1–2 weeks helps reduce tolerance and psychological strain. Data here are anecdotal; individuals vary widely in sensitivity and response, so risk management should err on the side of under‑dosing and patience.",

    "notes": "Boxed warning: Lamotrigine can cause serious skin reactions including Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis; risk is highest 2–8 weeks after initiation and increases with high starting doses, rapid titration, and concurrent valproate. Discontinue at first sign of rash unless clearly non–drug-related; stopping may not prevent progression—seek urgent medical care. Serious systemic reactions (DRESS/anticonvulsant hypersensitivity) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are rare but life-threatening; fever, lymphadenopathy, facial edema, hepatitis, or multi-organ signs require immediate evaluation. Lamotrigine half-life is prolonged to ~48–59 h with valproate and shortened to ~13.5–15 h with enzyme-inducing antiepileptics; removal or addition of inducers/inhibitors can markedly change levels, so doses often need adjustment. Estrogen-containing contraceptives can reduce lamotrigine exposure by about half during active-pill weeks with rebound increases during placebo weeks; some patients report intermenstrual bleeding and may require dose changes and/or level monitoring. During pregnancy, lamotrigine clearance increases (risk of breakthrough seizures/mood symptoms) and falls rapidly postpartum (toxicity risk if the pregnancy-up-titrated dose is not reduced); therapeutic drug monitoring or close clinical monitoring is recommended in these settings. If treatment is interrupted for several days, re-titration from a low dose is generally required to mitigate rash risk; do not resume the previous full dose without prescriber guidance. Overdose has caused ataxia, nystagmus, seizures, coma, and conduction abnormalities; there is no specific antidote—supportive care is indicated. Lamotrigine may cause false-positive phencyclidine (PCP) urine screens. Community reports suggest attenuated subjective effects of dissociatives (e.g., ketamine) and possibly classic psychedelics while on maintenance lamotrigine; this is anecdotal and should not prompt unsupervised dose omissions given the rash risk from improper re‑initiation.",

Insomnia is commonly reported after larger doses or late dosing; several experienced users advise avoiding dosing after morning hours. Community reports flag nausea and a “drained”/serotonin‑depletion‑like feeling at higher cumulative doses, consistent with some serotonergic activity; avoid frequent redosing and keep use infrequent. A 5‑day self‑medication episode totaling ~5 g led to hospital evaluation for palpitations/agitation per a widely shared warning; this illustrates overdose potential from misjudged potency—start low, avoid solutions with unknown concentration, and do not use daily. As with other stimulants, combinations with MAOIs are high‑risk (hypertensive crisis/serotonin toxicity); stimulant + alcohol or high caffeine increases cardiac strain and dehydration risk; tramadol raises seizure risk when combined with stimulants—avoid. If any signs of liver injury (e.g., dark urine, right‑upper‑quadrant pain, jaundice) emerge, stop immediately and seek medical care.",

Use accredited drug checking when possible to verify contents and detect adulterants.\n• Start with an allergy test (≈1/4 of a tentative threshold/common dose) at home with a trusted sober person; idiosyncratic reactions can occur even at low doses.\n• Avoid combining with MAOIs (including linezolid antibiotic and methylene blue), which substantially increase monoamine levels and have produced serotonin toxicity with other serotonergic agents.\n• Combining with other stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, cathinones) raises risks of tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction, hyperthermia, and cardiac events; avoid.\n• If chest pain, severe headache, agitation with confusion, hallucinations, high body temperature, or loss of consciousness occur, seek emergency care; these may signal cardiovascular complications or serotonin toxicity.\n• Do not self-treat stimulant jitteriness or tachycardia with over‑the‑counter beta‑blockers; clinical management of stimulant toxicity is nuanced and unopposed‑alpha reactions have been reported, though evidence is mixed.\n• Maintain cooling breaks and sip fluids slowly (about 500 ml/hour max) during prolonged activity to reduce overheating risk; avoid overhydration (hyponatremia).\n• Consider that CYP2D6 inhibitors (notably bupropion, paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine/quinine, ritonavir) can raise levels or alter effects of amphetamine‑like stimulants; similar risk may apply here—dose very cautiously or avoid these combinations.\n• Medications that lower seizure threshold (e.g., bupropion, tramadol) may increase risk of seizures when combined with stimulants; avoid such combinations.\n• Oral use is preferred for unknown compounds; insufflation can cause local tissue injury and unpredictable kinetics, as seen with other synthetic stimulants.\n• Avoid driving or hazardous tasks during and after use; residual insomnia, irritability, and low mood can persist into the next day.\n• Pregnancy: by class analogy to amphetamines, stimulants in pregnancy are associated with higher rates of growth restriction, prematurity, and hypertensive complications; avoid.

    "notes": "Kratom’s main alkaloids are mitragynine and, at much lower natural abundance, 7‑hydroxymitragynine (7‑OH). Oral mitragynine is hepatically oxidized (primarily via CYP3A isoforms) to 7‑OH, which mediates much of its MOR‑agonist analgesia; CYP3A inhibition can reduce both analgesia and mitragynine‑linked respiratory effects in animals, indicating route- and enzyme‑dependent effects. Treat kratom like an opioid for safety: combining with alcohol, benzodiazepines, other opioids, or GHB/GBL substantially increases overdose risks including respiratory compromise and aspiration, even if mitragynine shows biased agonism relative to classical opioids. Leaf potency is highly variable (mitragynine commonly 12–21 mg/g; some resins 35.6–62.6 mg/g), so dose titration is essential; avoid rapid re‑dosing because nausea and delayed peaks are common. Be wary of ‘enhanced’ or ‘fortified’ products: ‘Krypton’ products in Europe were adulterated with O‑desmethyltramadol and associated with deaths. Rare but documented kratom‑associated cholestatic liver injury exists; discontinue and seek care if pruritus, dark urine, jaundice, or severe abdominal pain occur. Pregnancy and lactation: neonatal opioid withdrawal has been reported with maternal kratom use; breastfeeding is discouraged due to unknown infant exposure to multiple CNS‑active alkaloids. Because mitragynine can inhibit CYP2D6/3A in vitro, co‑medications metabolized by these pathways (e.g., many antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta‑blockers, opioids) may have altered levels; avoid intentional potentiation with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., grapefruit, certain azoles/macrolides) and monitor for adverse effects. High‑dose, chronic use can cause constipation, sweating, dizziness, and tolerance; maintain hydration, fiber intake, and consider periodic ‘off‑days’ to reduce escalation.

It is intended for short‑term use (generally ≤ 2–3 weeks) alongside rest and physical therapy; prolonged use lacks strong evidence and increases adverse effects. It is contraindicated in hyperthyroidism, during the acute recovery phase of myocardial infarction, and in patients with arrhythmias, heart block/conduction disturbances, or heart failure. Combining with serotonergic drugs (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs/MAOIs) has produced case‑reported serotonin syndrome; discontinue and seek care if agitation, hyperreflexia, clonus, or autonomic instability occur. Additive CNS depression occurs with alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, and Z‑hypnotics; avoid mixing or use minimal doses with extended spacing if medically unavoidable. Potent anticholinergic properties can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, confusion, and at high doses anticholinergic delirium; avoid dehydration and hot environments and monitor for urinary retention, especially in males with BPH. Overdose shares tricyclic‑like cardiotoxicity (QRS widening, arrhythmias) and seizure risk; emergent care should include ECG monitoring and serum alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate when QRS is prolonged. Extended‑release capsules must not be chewed or crushed; if swallowing is difficult, contents may be sprinkled on applesauce and swallowed without chewing, then rinse the mouth to avoid retained granules. Hepatic impairment and older age substantially prolong half‑life and raise exposure, warranting lower starting doses (e.g., 5 mg) or avoidance in moderate–severe hepatic disease. Although euphoria is occasionally reported anecdotally at high doses, sedation, dysphoria, and delirium are more common outcomes; deliberate recreational escalation is therefore high‑risk and not recommended.",

    "notes": "- Onset is slow (often 60–120 min oral). Premature redosing is a leading cause of unexpectedly high total intake; wait at least 2 hours before considering any booster.\n- Intranasal use is discouraged due to strong nasal irritation and variable absorption; oral is the safer, more predictable ROA.\n- Salt form matters. By weight, pure 6‑APB succinate delivers about 72% of the active base compared with HCl; many commercial succinate batches contain substantial excess succinic acid, further lowering potency. Calibrate doses conservatively and test new batches.\n- Product variability and mislabeling are common; recent Swiss and Dutch drug‑checking alerts continue to find 6‑APB in place of MDMA in pills and, in rare cases, mixtures or adulterants. Use reagent testing and, where available, lab‑based drug checking before consumption.\n- Duration is longer than MDMA; plan dosing early in the day if sleep is needed the same night, and expect residual stimulation into the following day.\n- Hydration and temperature: during dancing/heat, sip isotonic fluids (~300 mL/hour), take cool‑down breaks, and avoid overhydration; isotonic drinks reduce hyponatremia risk compared with plain water.\n- Serotonin‑toxicity risk increases with MAOIs, SSRIs/SNRIs, tramadol/DXM, or other serotonergic releasers; avoid such combinations and seek urgent care if confusion, hyperthermia, rigidity, or clonus occur.\n- 5‑HT2B receptor agonists (e.g., fenfluramine metabolite norfenfluramine) are linked to valvular heart disease with chronic exposure. Because benzofurans can activate 5‑HT2B in vitro, frequent or high‑dose 6‑APB use may plausibly elevate long‑term valvulopathy risk; spacing use and avoiding chronic patterns is prudent.\n- Polydrug stimulant combinations (e.g., with amphetamine) amplify cardiovascular strain and should be avoided; if undertaken, significantly reduce doses and do not redose during the peak.\n- Recent market reviews indicate 6‑APB continues to circulate as an NPS in parts of Europe; quality and composition vary year‑to‑year—further reason to test batches and titrate cautiously.

    "notes": "Rationale: Core pharmacology. Salvinorin A is a potent and selective kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist with negligible activity at 5-HT2A, which explains its non-classical psychedelic profile and frequent dysphoria/derealization compared with serotonergic psychedelics. This also justifies removing the prior unsubstantiated fluoxetine (SSRI) ‘CNS depressant’ interaction. Sources include Roth et al. and EMCDDA/EUDA profile. Rationale: Route-dependent activity. Swallowed (gastric) dosing is largely inactive due to first-pass inactivation; psychoactivity depends on buccal/sublingual absorption or inhalation. This underpins replacing the prior ‘oral’ microgram table with ‘sublingual’ and ‘vaporized’ routes and warning that simply swallowing is ineffective. Rationale: Microgram potency and measurement risk. Effective vaporized doses often begin near 200–500 µg; ‘full’ effects are commonly reported at 0.6–1.0 mg with steep dose–response. Microgram-level dosing requires a lab-grade balance or pre-measured materials to reduce the risk of accidental overwhelming experiences. Rationale: Onset and duration. Vaporized salvinorin A has onset within 20–60 s, very brief peak (≈1–5 min), and main effects resolve within 5–20 min; sublingual/tincture routes are slower-on, longer-lasting (up to ~2 h). This informs planning, sitter use, and driving restrictions post-episode. Rationale: Safety/sitter and environment. Profound disorientation, amnesia, ataxia, and wandering can occur; a sober sitter and hazard-free setting (seated/lying, away from glass, fire, edges) reduce injuries. Avoid smoking/vaporizing while standing; do not operate vehicles until fully baseline. Rationale: Interactions. • Antagonists: Competitive opioid antagonists (naltrexone, naloxone) block salvinorin A’s effects; this is not dangerous but makes dosing unpredictable if on therapy. • CNS depressants: DrugBank lists numerous sedative class interactions raising CNS depression risk; combining with alcohol, benzos, or opioids likely increases accident risk during incapacitating episodes. • MAOIs: TripSit notes anecdotal potentiation; treat as unknown/synergistic and avoid. Rationale: Tolerance. Community and summary sources suggest minimal or no rapid tolerance; some report a subjective ‘reverse tolerance’ or sensitization with experience, but this remains anecdotal. Thus we keep formal tolerance ‘unknown’ and advise not to escalate doses within a session. Rationale: Pharmacokinetics. Human half-life is not well defined; primate PET shows rapid brain clearance (~8 min), and rodent studies suggest a short systemic t1/2 (~75 min). This supports the brief intense window and the advice to plan the environment before dosing rather than redosing to ‘chase’ effects. Rationale: Solubility/formulation. EMCDDA and Erowid note salvinorin A is insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents; sublingual ethanol tinctures are used, with onset 5–10 min. This underlies specifying ‘sublingual’ rather than general ‘oral’ and cautioning that ethanol solutions are typical; avoid denatured alcohol/DMSO for safety. Rationale: Mental health screening. EMCDDA cautions psychotic disturbances may occur in vulnerable individuals; brief episodes can precipitate longer disturbances. Users with a history of psychosis should avoid. Rationale: Not detected on standard drug tests. Salvinorin A is not included in common SAMHSA-5 panels, though specialized testing is possible. This is relevant for informed consent, not encouragement. ",

    "notes": "Nitazene opioids are frequently implicated in severe poisonings due to extreme potency and unexpected appearance in unregulated supplies, including fake medicines that mimic oxycodone/benzodiazepines; this raises overdose risk, especially in people without opioid tolerance. Naloxone reverses nitazene overdoses, but multiple sequential doses may be needed; always call emergency services and continue rescue breathing while awaiting help. Fentanyl test strips do not detect nitazenes, so a negative FTS does not rule out presence of NDP or other nitazenes. Drug checking services report nitazenes appearing where they are not expected (e.g., samples sold as oxycodone); treat all unknown powders/pills as potentially containing high‑potency opioids. Co‑exposure to other sedatives (illicit benzodiazepines) or veterinary α2‑agonists (e.g., xylazine, medetomidine) is increasingly common and can blunt response to naloxone or prolong sedation; airway support and medical care are critical even after naloxone. Because nitazenes may be present at very low concentrations, routine test kits and many FTS will miss them; laboratory drug checking is preferable where available. Doses at the microgram scale require calibrated equipment; volumetric dosing is strongly preferred to reduce measurement error. Avoid rapid redosing—some users report cumulative sedation with nitazenes over hours, increasing the risk of delayed respiratory depression. Given market variability and absent human pharmacokinetic data for NDP specifically, treat potency and duration as uncertain, start well below any published ranges, and avoid mixing with other depressants.",

    "notes": "Allergy-test and dose accurately: Because active doses are in the low tens of milligrams, always use a 0.001 g (milligram) scale and allergy test 1–2 mg before a first full dose; start low and wait at least 3 hours before considering any change to avoid stacking a delayed onset. Misrepresentation risk is real: pressed “2C‑B” or “mescaline” tablets and powders occasionally contain other phenethylamines; use multiple reagents and, where possible, a drug-checking lab (Energy Control/TEDI-type services) to confirm identity before dosing. Reagents: On Marquis, 2C‑T‑2 typically shows a salmon/orange‑to‑red reaction, contrasting with 2C‑B’s green; no single reagent can confirm identity—use at least Marquis, Mecke, and Froehde and interpret within ~60 seconds. Avoid nasal use: Insufflation produces a very rapid, intense come‑up and is consistently reported to cause severe burning, higher nausea/vomiting rates, and vasoconstriction; 2C‑T‑x intranasal use has been linked to serious toxicity and deaths (notably with 2C‑T‑7). Hydration and heat: Like many psychedelics with mild stimulation, overheating can occur in hot, crowded settings; take breaks to cool down and sip fluids slowly (about 500 mL per hour maximum) to avoid both dehydration and over‑hydration. Redosing and tolerance: Acute tolerance develops rapidly; redosing late in the experience adds side‑effects more than benefits. Leave at least a week between substantial psychedelic sessions to reduce tolerance and mental fatigue. Set/setting and support: Anxiety and body‑load are common at the peak; a trusted sober sitter, calm environment, and controlled sensory input reduce risk of panic and injury. Emergency response: If severe agitation, hyperthermia, or signs of serotonin toxicity occur (high fever, clonus, confusion), seek medical care; lay responders should focus on cooling, reassurance, and avoiding restraints that impair breathing—do not attempt to self‑medicate. Rectal route hygiene: If using rectal administration to reduce nausea, dissolve in sterile water, use clean applicators, and lubricant to minimize mucosal injury and infection risk. Drug checking and ID nuance: 2C‑T‑2 may be sold in capsules or powders; while 2C‑B is often in pressed tablets, both can be confused at point‑of‑sale; lab testing best differentiates them; reagent patterns aid but are not definitive. Legal & sourcing context: EU risk assessment concluded 2C‑T‑2 is a potent hallucinogen with no recognized medical use; many regions control it; legal risk adds to harm if medical help is delayed—carry accurate substance/dose info for responders.",

Compared with many cathinones, pyrrolidinophenones like MDPV/α‑PVP active at similar ranges have produced severe adverse reactions at small mis-measurements. • Expect powerful reinforcement: reports with 5‑DBFPV/analogues describe strong 'fiending' and compulsive redosing; pre-portion doses and set a hard session limit before starting to reduce escalation. • Cardiovascular strain and vasoconstriction (cold extremities, headache, chest pressure) are common with this class; stop use if chest pain, severe headache, or shortness of breath occurs and seek urgent care. • Insufflation can worsen local vasoconstriction and cause significant nasal irritation; oral dosing is generally less compulsive and less harsh on mucosa. • Vaporizing/smoking produces a near‑instant onset that can markedly increase craving and redose frequency; this also spikes heart rate and blood pressure, so conservative testing or avoiding this ROA is prudent. • Injection of synthetic cathinones carries high risks (tissue damage, infections, rapid tolerance, severe psychosis); avoid IV/IM use. • Sleep deprivation strongly amplifies anxiety, paranoia and psychosis risks with pyrrolidinophenones; plan for adequate sleep and avoid multi‑day use. • Avoid combinations with MAOIs, tramadol, bupropion, or other stimulants; these mixtures are associated with hypertensive events, seizures, and toxic CNS overstimulation. • Caffeine, nicotine and synthetic cannabinoids can add to cardiovascular stress; keep caffeine low and avoid novel cannabinoids on stimulant days. • Drug checking: mislabeling within the cathinone market is common (e.g., α‑PVP sold as '3‑MMC'); reagent tests may be weak/ambiguous—use lab checking where available and titrate doses cautiously from very low if untested. • Even where checking is available, lab methods have limits (e.g., ~0.1% detection thresholds); trace adulterants may be missed—assume unknowns and proceed cautiously. • Hydration: sip small amounts of water regularly; avoid heavy alcohol, which increases dehydration and masks stimulant strain. • For anxious comedowns, small, pre‑planned doses of a prescribed benzodiazepine may help, but avoid stacking with alcohol, opioids, or Z‑hypnotics due to respiratory depression risk. • Do not drive or operate machinery while under acute effects or during the residual stimulation/insomnia window. • Individuals with cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, seizure disorders, or a history of stimulant‑induced psychosis are at elevated risk and should avoid this compound.",

    "notes": "AL-LAD is a lysergamide closely related to LSD, first synthesized in the 1970s and popularized as a research chemical in the 2010s. It is reported to produce a psychedelic experience similar to LSD but often described as more visually oriented, with a lighter, more euphoric, and less anxious character. It is usually sold on blotter paper and is active at microgram doses. There is little evidence of physical toxicity or long-term organ harm, but psychological risks (such as anxiety, panic, or precipitating mania/psychosis in vulnerable individuals) are possible, especially at high doses or in unsuitable settings. For drug checking, indole-positive reagents (Ehrlich) typically turn purple with lysergamides, and fresh LSD-family blotters fluoresce under UV; however, adulteration (e.g., adding tryptamine to mimic Ehrlich purple) can confound results—use multiple tests or a lab where possible. Avoid redosing for at least 3 hours; blotters vary in potency and occasionally contain unexpected substances with delayed onset. Store blotters cool, dark, and dry; UV light and heat accelerate degradation. Microgram potency makes precise measurement difficult—if handling liquid or powder, use volumetric dosing and label solutions clearly. AL-LAD is illegal in some jurisdictions.",

    "notes": "Insufflation: Multiple user reports describe intense, short-lived burn with prolonged rawness and next-day epistaxis; mitigate by finely crushing, using your own clean tool, alternating nostrils, and performing isotonic saline rinses pre/post. Acute effects: rapid rush (especially intranasal), sensory tunneling, limb numbness/ataxia, manic sociability; peaks within ~40–60 minutes and often fades by 2–3 hours. Redosing: short plateaus encourage frequent bumps—plan a hard cap on total session dose and time; waiting at least 90–120 minutes reduces stacking and helps gauge peak. Functionality trap: stimulation can feel higher and headspace shallower than 3-MeO-PCP, giving a deceptive sense of control; risky decisions (urban wandering, social disinhibition) and bingeing are common themes in reports. Urinary health: as with ketamine/MXE-class ACHs, frequent/heavy use is associated with LUTS and sometimes severe bladder injury; space sessions widely, hydrate moderately, and stop if any urinary pain, urgency, or hematuria appear. Combinations: avoid depressants (alcohol, GHB, opioids) due to aspiration/unconsciousness risk; avoid MAOIs and strong stimulants due to tachycardia/hypertension/mania potential; tramadol adds seizure and serotonergic risk. Mental health: dissociatives can precipitate paranoia/psychosis, especially with binges or sleep loss; avoid if you have a history of psychosis and ensure sleep after sessions. Driving: impairing even when you feel ‘functional’—do not drive or operate machinery until the next day and fully rested. Route-specific: rectal administration requires dilution and lubrication with gentle technique; avoid intravenous use (no documentation; unknown excipients). Equipment: use 0.001 g scales; never eyeball milligram quantities. Drug checking: mislabeling of ACHs is common—use reagent tests where available and prefer certified drug checking services to confirm identity/purity. Session hygiene: plan a sitter for higher doses; avoid eating heavy meals just before dosing to reduce nausea; have a calm, seated environment to reduce fall risk.",

    "notes": "• Metabolism rationale: Primary and secondary phenethylamines (like PEA) are preferentially degraded by MAO‑B; without MAOI, central effects are brief or absent. This implies any activity from MDMPEA is likely short and dose‑inefficient, with MAOIs dramatically and unpredictably increasing potency and duration. Evidence for MDMPEA in humans is lacking; harm reduction should assume high uncertainty.\n• MAOI risk: Combining phenethylamines with MAOIs can precipitate hypertensive crises, hyperthermia, agitation, and serotonin toxicity; irreversible MAOI effects can persist for weeks after stopping. Therefore, avoid MDMPEA for at least 14 days after irreversible MAOIs and several days after reversible MAOIs/RIMAs.\n• Redosing hazard: Short-acting stimulants foster repeated dosing within hours, increasing cardiovascular strain and worsening post‑use mood/crash; multiple community reports of PEA+MAOI show rapid cycles and harsh comedowns. Plan a hard stop time and avoid chasing diminishing returns.\n• Route risks: Nasal administration of phenethylamines tends to be more irritating, with sharper onsets, more side effects, and greater risk of dosing errors; long‑standing HR advice favors oral over nasal for phenethylamines. Unknowns magnify these risks for MDMPEA.\n• Purity & identification: As an analytical standard/obscure compound, retail samples may be misidentified or adulterated. Use accredited drug checking services when possible; reagent kits cannot confirm identity or dose.\n• Health screening: Avoid entirely with cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperthyroidism, seizure history, or use of serotonergic or adrenergic medications. Monitor temperature, exertion, and hydration as with other stimulants.\n• Legal uncertainty: Legal status is unclear and jurisdiction‑specific. Treat as a research chemical that may fall under analogue/catch‑all controls; do not assume legality.\n• Practical HR: If ignoring the absence of data, use milligram‑accurate scales, perform allergy tests, space attempts by weeks, and never combine with MAOIs. Have a trusted sober sitter for first trials and avoid mixing with other stimulants or serotonergics. ",

    "notes": "Justification for harm-reduction additions: (1) Potency variability and causticity: Multiple recent user threads describe severe nasal burn, variable potency vs methadone (≈50–80%), and advise against intranasal or IV use; therefore dose ranges are conservative and insufflation is discouraged. (2) Accumulation risk: Users report long-acting effects and next-day sedation; spacing redoses ≥12–24 h reduces stacking risk. (3) QTc risk inference: Methadone inhibits hERG and prolongs QT; as a close structural analog lacking definitive human data, methiodone should be treated as potentially QT-prolonging—avoid/additively QT-prolonging drugs and consider ECG if using chronically or at higher doses. (4) CYP2B6 interactions: Methadone clearance is driven by CYP2B6; efavirenz/nevirapine markedly reduce methadone levels and precipitate withdrawal—similar interactions are plausible for methiodone, so monitor for underdosing with inducers and for oversedation with inhibitors. (5) Naloxone reversal: For long-acting opioids, repeated doses or infusion may be required due to naloxone’s shorter half-life; monitor for renarcotization. (6) Depressant combinations: TripSit and DrugWise emphasize high overdose risk when opioids are combined with alcohol, benzos, barbiturates, GHB, and gabapentinoids; avoid or use only under medical supervision with rescue naloxone available. (7) Drug checking: Unregulated opioids can be adulterated with fentanyls or nitazenes; lab drug-checking and use of appropriate test strips where available reduce risk—note fentanyl strips do not detect nitazenes. (8) ROA safety: Given frequent reports of harsh acidity, prefer oral capsules or well-diluted solutions; avoid IV/smoking to reduce tissue damage and unpredictable kinetics. (9) Tolerance/withdrawal: Expect rapid tolerance with daily use and prolonged withdrawal resembling methadone; plan spacing and avoid abrupt cessation. (10) Driving/impairment: Long-acting sedation and miosis can persist into the next day; avoid driving and hazardous tasks. First-aid in overdose: support airway/breathing; administer naloxone (repeat as needed) and seek emergency care; monitor for recurrence due to long duration.",

    "notes": "- Avizafone is a water‑soluble peptide prodrug that is rapidly converted in vivo to diazepam; therefore, most safety/effect considerations mirror diazepam rather than avizafone itself. Formal human IM PK data are limited in open sources.\n- Because avizafone (MW ≈ 430.18 g/mol) converts to diazepam (MW ≈ 284.74 g/mol), the theoretical maximum mass yield is ≈0.66 mg diazepam per 1 mg avizafone if conversion were complete; practical oral potency may be lower due to variable enzymatic conversion. This explains frequent anecdotal reports of avizafone feeling weaker per milligram than diazepam. Inference from molecular weights; see citations.\n- Diazepam and its active metabolite N‑desmethyldiazepam have long half‑lives (roughly 20–50 h and up to ~100 h, respectively), so accumulation with repeated doses is likely; residual impairment can persist into the next day. Avoid driving or operating machinery for at least 24 h after significant dosing and longer if sedated.\n- Strong CYP2C19/CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ketoconazole, omeprazole, macrolides, grapefruit) can raise diazepam levels and prolong sedation; enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John’s wort) can blunt effects. Genetic CYP2C19 poor metabolizers may experience exaggerated or prolonged responses.\n- Combining with opioids, alcohol, GHB/GBL, or other sedatives markedly increases the risk of respiratory depression, overdose, and death. This risk is documented across epidemiologic and clinical sources; avoid such combinations.\n- Intended clinical use of avizafone was to enable parenteral delivery of diazepam without organic solvents. If someone chooses to inject despite risks, avoid improvised propylene glycol/ethanol solutions (propylene glycol toxicity is a known hazard with parenteral benzos), use only sterile water or bacteriostatic water, sterile technique, new needles, and rotate sites; seek medical attention for signs of infection (redness, warmth, pain, fever).\n- Intranasal avizafone appears inconsistently effective in user reports, likely because efficient conversion occurs systemically; oral or medically administered IM routes produce more reliable diazepam exposure.\n- Powder is often reported as hygroscopic and sticky; if using volumetric dosing, prepare small volumes, label clearly, refrigerate short‑term, and discard if cloudiness, precipitate, or odor develops. Household preservation practices cannot guarantee sterility; contamination risk rises with time.\n- Tolerance develops with frequent use; limit use days per week and avoid consecutive‑day dosing. If physically dependent, seek a clinician‑supervised diazepam taper rather than abrupt cessation to reduce seizure/withdrawal risk.\n- Mixed stimulant–depressant use can mask intoxication; once the stimulant wears off, excessive benzodiazepine effect may unmask, increasing overdose risk.",

Drug checking and European monitoring document frequent nitazene involvement in poisonings and counterfeit ‘oxycodone/hydromorphone’ tablets; negative fentanyl test strips do not rule out nitazenes. Where available, use full-spectrum drug checking (e.g., mass spectrometry); FTIR alone may miss <5% constituents and current nitazene-specific strips may not detect all analogues. Microgram potency demands volumetric dosing; avoid weighing tiny amounts directly. For oral/sublingual use, dilute to a low concentration to enable accurate measurement; never inject alcohol/PG-based solutions. Avoid combining with any sedatives. After any abstinence of ≥48 h, markedly reduce dose due to rapid loss of tolerance. Grapefruit and other CYP3A4/CYP2D6 inhibitors can increase effects and overdose risk. If injecting occurs, the safest option is to avoid injection; if not avoided, use sterile water, new equipment, and test a very small ‘allergy dose’ with supervision; never share supplies.",

    "notes": "Harm-reduction essentials: (1) Cancer risk differs by product: areca/betel quid chewing (with or without tobacco) is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), while purified arecoline itself has been classified as possibly carcinogenic (Group 2B); reducing or avoiding quid use reduces exposure to multiple carcinogens found in quids, but arecoline exposure still carries mechanistic carcinogenic concerns. (2) Slaked lime raises oral pH and can enhance buccal absorption but also causes chronic mucosal irritation and contributes to oral submucous fibrosis risk observed in quid users; avoid lime if not culturally required. (3) Salt/base conversion matters: 1 mg arecoline HBr ≈ 0.66 mg freebase; dosing errors from this confusion are common—dose conservatively, especially when switching products. (4) Respiratory risk: muscarinic agonists can provoke bronchospasm and heavy secretions; avoid inhalation routes if you have asthma/COPD or any reactive airway disease; stop immediately if wheeze, chest tightness, or dyspnea occur. (5) Cardiovascular risk: arecoline can lower heart rate and blood pressure via M2/M3 activation; those with baseline bradycardia, on AV‑node–slowing drugs, or with coronary disease should avoid use. (6) GI risk: increased acid secretion and peristalsis can aggravate peptic ulcer disease or precipitate cramping and diarrhea; take with water and avoid on an empty stomach if sensitive. (7) Pregnancy/lactation: avoid—arecoline is detectable in breast milk and maternal quid use is associated with low birth weight and adverse pregnancy outcomes in human studies. (8) Liver disease: habitual areca/betel use is epidemiologically linked to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; avoid in chronic liver disease or viral hepatitis. (9) Overdose/poisoning signs are typical cholinergic excess (salivation, sweating, miosis, vomiting/diarrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, confusion/seizure in severe cases); first steps are to stop exposure, remove any quid/lozenge, rinse mouth, sit or lie down, hydrate if able, and seek urgent medical care—atropine is an effective antidote but must be given by clinicians. (10) Stacking doses: the short peak encourages redosing; wait at least one full hour before considering any increment to avoid cumulative cholinergic toxicity. (11) Co-use with tobacco or alcohol increases long-term cancer risk for oral and upper aerodigestive sites; safest choice is to avoid those combinations entirely. (12) Product variability is high across areca nuts and unregulated arecoline products; start at the low end, test a single‑substance product before mixing, and consider drug‑checking practices where available.",

LC–MS surveys have identified retail products mislabeled as “kratom extracts” that actually contain high, synthetic-level 7-OH with atypical alkaloid profiles. Start low, assume label inaccuracy, and avoid redosing for at least 6–8 h. 7-OH is a potent μ-opioid agonist with G-protein-biased signaling; in animals it reliably produces respiratory depression comparable to morphine that is reversible with naloxone. Overdose risk rises steeply when combined with other depressants. Keep naloxone accessible and ensure companions know how to use it. Human kratom studies show 7-OH appears in plasma as a metabolite with a multi-hour half-life and can accumulate with repeated dosing; direct 7-OH pharmacokinetics in humans remain insufficiently characterized—plan spacing and avoid stacking. Commercial tablets/shots/gummies vary widely in true content; community reports indicate that 2–5 mg of verified material can produce strong opioid effects in non-tolerant users, while many gas-station products are under- or mis-labeled. Mitragynine-to–7-OH metabolic formation is CYP3A4-mediated; while this matters when combining 7-OH with kratom leaf (which contains mitragynine), it does not directly apply to pure 7-OH dosing, whose clearance is largely phase II (UGT)–mediated and for which clinically significant UGT interactions appear unlikely at typical exposures. Standard opioid immunoassays may miss mitragynine/7-OH; targeted LC–MS/MS is usually required, and 7-OH can be unstable in urine, complicating quantitation. Avoid driving or hazardous tasks for the rest of the day after dosing; sedation, miosis, and psychomotor impairment can persist beyond the peak. People with sleep apnea, COPD, or on multiple CNS depressants are at elevated risk of hypoventilation.",

    "notes": "- Identity and purity: This compound first appeared in EU early warning logs in late 2015; availability has been sporadic and mislabeling within the tryptamine/benzofuran scene is documented. Whenever possible, use an accredited drug checking service; single reagents are not reliable to confirm identity. Avoid assuming it is 5‑MeO‑DiPT or 5‑MeO‑DMT based on name alone.\n- Dose variability: Community reports span from threshold activity near 10–20 mg oral to strong effects above 100 mg, suggesting variability in material, salt forms, or individual sensitivity. Treat any new batch as unknown potency and titrate cautiously with a milligram scale and volumetric dosing.\n- GI effects: Diarrhoea, stomach cramping, and post‑come‑up headache are frequently reported, especially at higher oral doses. Plan hydration and electrolytes, avoid heavy meals pre-dose, and don’t stack with other GI‑active agents. Persistent vomiting, bloody stools, or severe abdominal pain warrant medical evaluation.\n- Restlessness/legs: Akathisia‑like ‘restless legs’ and body jitter are reported at moderate to high doses; avoid stimulants on the day and consider calm, low‑stimulation settings to reduce agitation.\n- Insufflation care: The intranasal route has a fast onset and shorter total duration but increases local irritation; limit repeated lines, use isotonic rinses afterward, and allow several days of recovery.\n- Redosing: Redosing during the peak tends to increase somatic load more than desirable effects. If chosen at all, wait until effects largely resolve; avoid serial redoses due to unknown pharmacokinetics.\n- Spacing: Allow at least 7–14 days between trials to reduce tolerance, confusion of dose–response, and cumulative stress.\n- Set/setting and consent: Mild entactogenic and erotic tones are reported by some users; plan boundaries and consent in advance and avoid mixing with alcohol or sedatives that impair judgment.\n- Emergencies: Signs of serotonin toxicity (agitation, clonus/tremor, hyperreflexia, hyperthermia) require urgent care. For severe anxiety or dangerous behaviour, a sober sitter and calm environment help; benzodiazepines can abort acute agitation but carry their own risks and should not be pre‑loaded casually.",

    "notes": "Reasoning for harm‑reduction additions (with sources): 1) Long half‑life means next‑day impairment is plausible; most adults exhibit a 21–54 h elimination half‑life (mean ~30 h), so sedation/cognitive slowing can linger into the following day. Advise against driving, climbing, or operating tools until fully alert. 2) IM olanzapine combined with benzodiazepines has post‑marketing signals of severe cardiorespiratory depression; authoritative summaries advise against parenteral co‑administration. Keep at least an hour separation in clinical settings and avoid DIY IM use. 3) CNS depressant stacking raises overdose risk. Opioids, alcohol, gabapentinoids and sedating antihistamines add respiratory depression and hypotension; several case series show hypoxia and rare airway interventions after parenteral olanzapine, often amid polysubstance use. Keep the person on their side (recovery position), monitor breathing, and call emergency services if difficult to arouse, cyanotic, or with slow/irregular respirations. 4) Smoking status and CYP1A2 modulators change olanzapine exposure: tobacco smoke and carbamazepine can lower levels and reduce effectiveness, while fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin can increase levels and sedation. Sudden smoking cessation can increase exposure; dose‑sensitivity may rise in non‑smokers. 5) QT risk: meta‑analyses suggest olanzapine has minimal QT prolongation at licensed doses; however, when combined with strong QT‑prolongers or in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, prudence (hydration, K/Mg repletion, ECG if symptomatic) is reasonable. 6) Metabolic harms accumulate with repeated use (weight gain, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia). This argues against frequent ‘trip‑abort’ reliance; prefer non‑pharmacologic de‑escalation first and reserve olanzapine for rare crises. Monitor weight and glucose if usage becomes recurrent. 7) Overdose can mimic opioid toxicity (miosis, respiratory depression, coma). In suspected overdose, prioritize airway/ventilation and seek urgent care; activated charcoal can meaningfully reduce AUC if given early in medical settings. Do not give stimulants to ‘counteract’ sedation. 8) ODT specifics: Zyprexa Zydis disintegrates within seconds and is swallowed; absorption is gastrointestinal. This makes cheeking harder but does not guarantee trans‑mucosal delivery. 9) ‘Trip‑killing’: Community reports describe partial-to-complete attenuation of LSD/psilocybin within ~20–45 min after 5–10 mg PO/ODT, often followed by sleep; responses vary and some report paradoxical anxiety/delirium if taken late or at low doses. Start low (2.5–5 mg) if attempting, have a sober sitter, and avoid stacking sedatives. 10) Masking effect: When used during stimulant or empathogen intoxication, olanzapine may blunt the ‘high’ while not fixing hypertension/hyperthermia; seek medical help rather than assuming safety.

Community consensus suggests roughly 0.25 mg phenazolam can feel comparable to about 10 mg diazepam for sedation/anxiolysis, but equivalence varies widely and should not be used to justify redosing. Volumetric dosing with ethanol (40–50%) or propylene glycol and an oral syringe is strongly advised to avoid sub‑mg mismeasurement. Avoid redosing within 4–6 hours: several users report a delayed set‑in and late peak, with blackouts when redosing too early. Mixing with opioids, alcohol, or GHB is a leading driver of fatal and non‑fatal poisonings; benzos are frequently found in counterfeit benzodiazepine tablets and in the unregulated opioid supply. Where available, use drug checking: fentanyl test strips can detect opioid adulteration, and benzo and xylazine strips exist but are not universally validated; FTIR services and professional drug checking reports repeatedly find benzodiazepine adulteration in pressed tablets and street fentanyl. In an overdose, administer naloxone for suspected opioids but understand it will not reverse benzodiazepine sedation; flumazenil is hospital‑only and can precipitate seizures in benzodiazepine‑tolerant or mixed‑overdose patients. Do not drive or operate machinery during the effect window and for the following day; residual impairment and amnesia are common. Long‑term or frequent use markedly increases dependence risk; taper only with medical guidance, typically using a longer‑acting benzodiazepine.

    "notes": "Mechanism: Androst-7-one/androstadien-7-one derivatives inhibit aromatase competitively in human placental microsomes (not suicidally), so estrogen suppression is dose- and exposure-dependent; plan dosing assuming a competitive inhibitor rather than an irreversible binder. Labs: For any non-trivial use, obtain baseline lipids and liver enzymes and recheck periodically; estradiol monitoring should use a sensitive assay when possible to detect over-suppression. Bone and joints: Class-wide AI use is associated with arthralgia and lower bone mineral density over time; avoid extended continuous use and consider bone health if cycles are repeated. Potency variability: Over-the-counter products vary in identity and dose; start conservatively (even ≤5–12.5 mg) and titrate only with symptoms and lab feedback to avoid an E2 crash. Cycle length: Limit to the minimal effective duration; long daily use increases risk of fatigue, mood changes, libido loss, and joint pain reported by users. ROA caveats: Sublingual and transdermal routes are user-invented with unknown bioavailability; prefer oral unless you have a specific reason and can monitor. Stopping: After discontinuation, expect estrogen to rebound toward baseline within days; tapering or skip-day patterns may reduce swings. Sex-specific risks: Contraindicated in pregnancy; in premenopausal women, AIs can stimulate ovaries via feedback and are generally inappropriate outside medical care. Stacking: Combining with other anti-estrogenic agents (SERMs, strong AIs, DHT derivatives, or 5α-reductase inhibitors) can push estrogen too low; add one lever at a time and verify with labs. Lipids: AIs may worsen lipid profile; combining with 17-alkylated oral steroids further strains HDL/LDL—monitor lipids and consider discontinuation if ratios deteriorate.",

    "notes": "3‑MAR appears to share aminorex‑class risks: epidemiology links aminorex exposure to drug‑induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); repeated or sustained use of aminorex‑like stimulants may elevate PAH risk in susceptible individuals. Avoid frequent or chronic use; stop and seek medical evaluation if you develop exertional shortness of breath, chest pain, or syncope in the days to weeks after use. Aminorex derivatives have produced seizures in animal studies at higher doses; seizure risk is likely increased when combined with tramadol, bupropion, or during sleep‑deprived binges. Hydration strategy should balance overheating and hyponatremia: in hot/active settings, sip roughly 250–500 mL per hour of an electrolyte beverage; avoid compulsive over‑drinking plain water. Redose spacing: wait at least 2–3 hours before considering any additional dose; avoid overnight binges because reinforcement can mask accumulating cardiovascular and neurotoxic strain. Nasal use can be highly caustic for aminorex analogues; finely crush, use small amounts, avoid repeated back‑to‑back lines, and gently rinse with isotonic saline afterwards to limit mucosal injury. Smoking/vaping freebase gives a rapid rush that strongly encourages pipe‑reloading; use pre‑measured tiny loads, let effects plateau before reconsidering, and ventilate to reduce lung irritation from hot vapour. Given the niche market, mis‑sold or mis‑identified powders are a major risk; prefer GC‑MS/FT‑IR drug‑checking when available and avoid use when analytical verification is not possible. People with a history of hypertension, heart disease, or prior stimulant‑induced chest symptoms should avoid aminorex analogues. Sleep after‑care: allow a full night’s rest, rehydrate with electrolytes, and consider non‑sedating recovery strategies first; be cautious with high benzo doses for ‘comedowns’ due to next‑day impairment and respiratory risk.",

Early threads and reports describe cyputylone as relatively stimulating with modest euphoria and notable body-load (jaw tension, GI upset, vasoconstriction), particularly intranasally. Some report activity at 20–30 mg rectal and 60–120 mg oral, but potency appears inconsistent across batches and vendors, and interest has remained low in user communities. Reagent tests can rule out some expected actives but cannot confirm identity; multiple reagents and, ideally, spectrometric analysis (FTIR/GC-MS) are needed. Because many '3‑MMC/4‑MMC' or 'MDMA-like' samples are mis-sold cathinones with very different potency windows, treat unfamiliar material as unknown: test a tiny amount first, avoid same-day mixing with serotonergics, and do not chase a weak come-up with repeated redoses. During dancing/heat exposure, prefer small, regular sips of electrolyte-containing fluids (about 250–500 mL per hour) and take cooling breaks; avoid overhydration to reduce hyponatremia risk. Individuals with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, seizure history, or on serotonergic/MAOI therapy should avoid cyputylone. Sleep disturbance after use is common; avoid compensating with alcohol or high benzo doses, prioritize dark/cool sleep environment, gentle nutrition, and non-pharmacologic wind-down.

Carry naloxone in case opioids/nitazenes contaminate supplies. • Naloxone will not treat stimulant toxicity itself, nor non‑opioids like xylazine/medetomidine; still administer it if someone is unresponsive because hidden opioids may be involved, and call emergency services. • Recent drug checking has occasionally found fentanyl/nitazenes and sedatives in samples sold as crack/cocaine; use local drug‑checking services where available and avoid using alone. • Levamisole and phenacetin are common adulterants in cocaine in some regions; levamisole is associated with immune dysfunction—seek medical care if you develop fever, mouth sores, or skin lesions after use. • Use a purpose‑made glass stem and your own mouthpiece; avoid sharing to reduce transmission of blood‑borne viruses (e.g., hepatitis C). Keep lips moisturized to prevent cracking/bleeding and clean pipes regularly. • Vaporize, don’t burn: apply heat below the rock and inhale gently to reduce thermal injury and harshness. • Watch for chest pain, severe palpitations, shortness of breath, hyperthermia, confusion, or seizures—these are medical emergencies. Cool the environment, rest, and seek help early. • Pregnancy/breastfeeding: cocaine use is linked with miscarriage, premature labor, and neonatal harm; avoid use and seek medical support. • Hydrate with small sips; avoid heavy exertion/overheating; do not drive or operate machinery until well after the binge and sleep debt have resolved.",

Early public discussion threads (May–June 2025) on Bluelight and Reddit confirm recent market appearance and repeated advice to confirm identity by GC–MS/FT‑IR due to confusion with O‑PCPr or O‑PCE. Mislabelled dissociatives are a documented drug‑checking problem; don’t assume label accuracy. Effects appear dissociative with a shorter plateau than PCP and variable sedation; users warn of a ‘clear‑headed’ window at low doses that fosters redosing. Motor incoordination and analgesia increase accident risk; have a sober sitter, avoid heights/water, and do not drive until fully baseline the next day. Combining with alcohol/benzodiazepines or opioids substantially increases vomiting/aspiration and respiratory depression risk; if someone is unresponsive, place them in the recovery position and call emergency services. Tramadol should be avoided due to seizure and serotonin‑toxicity risk; other serotonergic mixes (MAOI/SSRI/SNRI) are of uncertain safety — best avoided until real data exist. Dissociatives can precipitate panic, derealisation, mania, and psychosis in susceptible individuals; screen your set/setting, keep doses low, and avoid if you have a psychosis or seizure history. For dosing precision, volumetric dosing (e.g., 10 mg/mL in PG or ethanol/water) reduces milligram‑scale error; start with 1–2 mg allergy tests separated by at least 24 h. For IM use, only inject fully dissolved, filtered, sterile solutions; non‑sterile injection risks abscesses and systemic infection. Frequent or high‑dose dissociative use is linked to tolerance and dependence; bladder toxicity is well‑documented for ketamine, but is uncharacterised for O‑PCP — still, watch for urinary symptoms and reduce frequency. Drug checking at a professional service (FT‑IR/GC–MS) is strongly recommended whenever possible; reagent kits alone cannot distinguish close analogues.",

    "notes": "Mechanism: PPAP is a deprenyl-derived catecholaminergic activity enhancer that increases impulse-dependent transmitter release without acting as a classical releaser or reuptake inhibitor; it also lacks measurable MAO inhibitory potency in preclinical work. This helps explain smoother stimulation with less stereotypy than amphetamine. Animal studies suggest PPAP and deprenyl enhance action potential–transmitter release coupling and increase inward Ca2+ current in sinoatrial fibers, implying dose-related effects on heart rate; persons with cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, or uncontrolled hypertension should avoid use or seek medical advice first. Human data are sparse; virtually all dosing and ROA information is anecdotal. Users often report clear-headed stimulation, increased task engagement, and minimal crash at 20–60 mg oral; anxiety and insomnia become more likely at higher or late-day doses. Combining PPAP with other stimulants is not reliably synergistic: preclinical data describe bidirectional antagonism with amphetamine/mazindol on locomotion, and community reports sometimes note blunted effects of other stimulants when co-administered; due to unpredictability and cardiovascular load, avoid such combinations. For sublingual use, some report local irritation/burning; test with very low amounts first. Parenteral routes (IM/IV) markedly increase infection and tissue-risk; oral or sublingual routes are safer. Use an accurate milligram scale; volumetric dosing (dissolving a known amount of the HCl salt into a measured volume) can improve precision when scales are unreliable. Appearance does not predict identity or purity; where available, use accredited drug checking (FTIR/GC-MS) services, as simple color reagents will not confirm PPAP identity. Space doses to manage tolerance and sleep: many users take at least several days off between uses and avoid dosing after mid-afternoon to reduce insomnia. Store in airtight, light-protected containers in a cool, dry place to limit degradation; avoid humidity.",

Expect psilocin‑typical physiological changes and duration, with some users reporting slightly heavier body load and nausea. Psilocin’s human half‑life is around 2–3 h; redosing within the same day stacks unpredictably and is discouraged. Because vendor products vary (freebase vs fumarate; 1:1 vs 2:1 salt), always titrate from a low dose, preferably after an allergy/threshold test session on a different day. For novel/RC tryptamines, prefer oral over vaping: heat can decompose esters to psilocin and organic acids, producing harsh inhalation and inconsistent dosing; several communities report decomposition when smoking/vaping 4‑AcO‑DMT, plausibly similar here. As with other indole tryptamines, an Ehrlich reagent should turn positive (indole), but reagent tests cannot confirm identity or purity; where available, use FT‑IR/GC‑MS drug checking. Beware misrepresentation in unregulated markets; lab testing services note limitations and discourage reliance on vendor‑posted results. Avoid MAOIs and lithium combinations; both have documented severe reactions with serotonergic psychedelics. SSRIs/SNRIs commonly blunt effects—do not compensate by taking more on top. For those on seizure‑threshold–lowering meds (e.g., bupropion, tramadol), avoid or proceed only with medical guidance. Practice standard psychedelic harm‑reduction: do a threshold allergy test first exposure, choose safe set/setting with a sober sitter for higher doses, avoid driving/unsafe environments, and wait at least a week between substantial sessions to minimize tolerance and psychological strain.",

    "notes": "Reasoning for harm-reduction additions, with sources: 1) Structural identity and synonyms verified via PiHKAL·info, which lists 3‑EtO‑PCP with SMILES CCOc1cccc(c1)C1(CCCCC1)N1CCCCC1 and links to PubChem CID 165361695; this supports naming, class, and structural inferences. 2) Primary community report describes 100 mg insufflated as very strong but tolerable with tolerance, and—critically—reports a delayed, excruciating intranasal/throat burn with soreness persisting days. This supports advising oral administration, cautious titration, and avoiding nasal ROA due to caustic irritation. The same post gives ROA-specific timing: ~10 min onset nasal, ~2–3 h peak, 6–7 h total, plus hazy stimulating afterglow. 3) PCP pages (Erowid) document ataxia, nystagmus, depersonalization, unpredictable behavior, seizures at high doses, and increased coma/respiratory risk when combined with CNS depressants; this justifies strong warnings against alcohol/GHB/benzodiazepines/opioids, as well as no-driving/operating machinery advice for at least the day of use. Cannabis is noted to have profound synergy with PCP, supporting placement under ‘caution’. 4) TripSit harm-reduction for PCP/3‑MeO‑PCP indicates that these are research chemicals with limited long-term data, advises avoiding redose early due to variable onset and steep dose-response in PCP analogues, and highlights potentiation by alcohol/benzodiazepines; this supports conservative titration and redose delays for 3‑EtO‑PCP by analogy. 5) Tramadol commonly lowers seizure threshold and has serotonergic activity; TripSit cautions against tramadol combinations broadly due to seizure/serotonin risks. Given dissociatives’ seizure risk at high doses, placing tramadol under ‘unsafe’ is justified. 6) Hydration and urinary health: heavy/frequent ketamine use is associated with cystitis-like urinary problems. While 3‑EtO‑PCP is not ketamine, advising users of dissociatives to monitor urinary symptoms and moderate frequency is prudent harm reduction extrapolated from dissociative literature. 7) Testing and misrepresentation: drug supply variability means mis-sales are plausible; promoting reagent-plus lab testing (FTIR/GC–MS) via drug checking services is appropriate. The cited Reddit post even includes GC–MS imagery for the sample tested; the Toronto Drug Checking Service is an example of a public lab resource. 8) Antipsychotics: Erowid notes severe hypotension when PCP is combined with chlorpromazine-like agents; users should not attempt self-treatment of agitation or confusion with such medications. 9) Mental health risks: PCP resources report psychotic episodes and aggressive or disinhibited behavior, supporting guidance to avoid if there is a history of psychosis/mania, ensure a calm setting, and have a sober sitter.

    "notes": "- Variable potency and frequent misrepresentation have been reported; some user reports historically attributed to MXE were actually other dissociatives. Always test with reagents and, where possible, obtain confirmation via analytical drug checking (e.g., GC–MS/LC–MS). Volumetric dosing reduces large weighing errors. Evidence: Erowid MXE dosage note warns about misrepresented samples; Erowid experience category “What Was in That?” documents mislabeling cases; Erowid dosing articles explain liquid measurement to improve accuracy. - Acute clinical presentations can combine ketamine-like dissociation with sympathomimetic signs (tachycardia, hypertension). Low-dose benzodiazepines were used in case series management. Evidence: ED case series of analytically confirmed MXE exposures. - A distinct acute cerebellar toxidrome (ataxia, nystagmus, incoordination) has been repeatedly described after insufflation; symptoms may last beyond the main psychoactive phase but are usually reversible. Evidence: three analytically confirmed cases. - Chronic harms: animal and in vitro data indicate MXE can induce bladder inflammation/fibrosis and renal toxicity similar to ketamine cystitis; monitor for urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, or hematuria and stop use if present. Evidence: mouse and rat studies and urothelial cell data. - Pharmacology: besides NMDA antagonism, MXE inhibits monoamine transporters with greatest potency at SERT (low micromolar), so serotonergic combinations may be more unpredictable than with ketamine. Active metabolites (O-desmethyl- and N-desethyl-MXE) retain NMDA-blocking activity and may extend/alter effects. Evidence: in vitro neuropharmacology profiles; NMDA IC50 data for MXE and metabolites. - Set/setting: high doses can cause immobility and loss of consciousness; use a sober sitter, clear physical hazards, and avoid heights/bodies of water. Evidence: harm-reduction guidance and effects summaries noting accident susceptibility. - ROA safety: avoid IV due to unknown cuts and insolubles; if choosing IM, use sterile water or saline, micron filtration, new sterile equipment, proper needle size/site, and aseptic technique to reduce abscess/infection risk. Evidence: Erowid injection basics; community harm-reduction guidance on filtration and sterile prep. - Nasal care: powders can irritate/anaesthetize mucosa; gentle isotonic saline rinse after sessions can reduce local irritation. Evidence: community HR guidance. - Driving/coordination: residual disequilibrium can last into the next day; do not drive or operate machinery until fully baseline. Evidence: TripSit duration (after-effects up to 48 h) and Erowid effects (accident susceptibility). - Legal risks: MXE is controlled in many jurisdictions (e.g., U.S. federally scheduled since July 6, 2022); penalties vary by region. Verify local law before possession. Evidence: Erowid legal status summary.",

    "notes": "Each 30-mg Asenlix®/Itravil® capsule yields roughly 4-5 mg d-amphetamine after first-pass metabolism; subjective strength is about 1/5-1/6 of an Adderall IR tablet. Peak plasma amphetamine appears 1-4 h post-dose. Elimination half-life for parent + metabolites is highly variable (1-17 h) and is prolonged in alkaline urine. Cardiovascular concerns parallel other amphetamines; case-control data link chronic anorectic use to pulmonary arterial hypertension, so limit weekly use and monitor BP. Urine screens >500 ng/mL 'amphetamine' after clobenzorex will also contain the specific metabolite 4-hydroxy-clobenzorex—confirmatory testing can distinguish therapeutic use from illicit amphetamine. Users emphasise smaller test doses (≤25 mg) due to biphasic profile: a short punchy alertness that dips after 2 h before a shallow, long tail. Split-dosing (e.g., 30 mg a.m. + 15 mg noon) reduces the midday slump. Stay hydrated, supplement magnesium/potassium, and schedule at least 48 h stimulant-free to keep tolerance manageable. Additional harm-reduction: avoid rapid redosing during the first 3 h; maintain hydration and electrolyte intake to offset anorexia/dehydration; avoid overheating and heavy exertion to mitigate hyperthermia risk; expect immunoassay urine tests to read 'amphetamine' after clobenzorex and seek GC/MS confirmation if needed.",

    "notes": "Fluminorex is the para‑trifluoromethyl analogue of aminorex; identity and structure are confirmed in PubChem, but there are no modern human pharmacokinetic data or clinical trials for this compound. Aminorex-class agents (including aminorex itself) have been causally associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); mechanistically, aminorex and several anorectics act as serotonin transporter substrates, a property implicated in drug‑induced PAH, so long, repeated, or high‑dose exposure may carry non‑trivial PAH risk even if immediate subjective effects seem benign. Because of this risk, avoid daily or continuous use, set strict cycle limits, and discontinue permanently if unexplained exertional dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or lower‑extremity edema appear; these warrant medical evaluation for PAH. The aminorex class also releases catecholamines (DAT/NET), so hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension are core dose‑dependent hazards; avoid co‑use with other stimulants and manage environment (cooling, rest breaks) to reduce heat burden. Interaction risk is heightened with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (contraindicated) and with serotonergic agents (SSRIs/SNRIs/releasers/triptans) due to the class’s measurable SERT activity; combinations can precipitate hypertensive or serotonin toxicity even at moderate doses. Dosing guidance here is intentionally conservative and derived from 4‑methylaminorex user summaries (10–25 mg typical) rather than fluminorex trials; begin with threshold dosing and allow full onset before considering any increase, especially with insufflation/vaporisation where impulsive redosing risk is high. Market unfamiliarity means mislabeling is plausible; multi‑reagent kits are only presumptive and can miss adulterants — laboratory analysis (GC‑MS/LC‑MS) through a drug checking service is the most reliable way to confirm identity and detect mixtures. If using despite the above, prioritize oral dosing, spacing sessions by at least 10–14 days, maintain hydration with electrolytes while avoiding over‑hydration, and plan for insomnia with a stimulant‑free sleep window; avoid sedative ‘comedown’ cocktails (e.g., high‑dose alcohol, GHB, benzodiazepines) which carry their own risks.",

    "notes": "Identity and naming: ‘EDMC’ refers to the β-keto cathinone bearing a 1,4-benzodioxine ring; it is distinct from EDMA (the non-β-keto amphetamine). Synonyms include βk‑EDMA and ED‑MC; confirm structure if purchasing. Market variability: early reports indicate inconsistent potency and frequent misrepresentation in the unregulated market; verify with multiple reagents and, where available, drug checking. Eutylone and dipentylone have been commonly sold as ‘MDMA’/‘new empathogens’ in recent years, so be alert for false positives and mixed samples. Pharmacology: as a ring‑substituted cathinone, EDMC is expected to act as a monoamine releasing agent across SERT > NET ≥ DAT (by analogy to methylone-class drugs), but there are no human pharmacokinetic data. Dose and duration: human dose–response is poorly characterized; use allergen test doses, weigh on a 0.001 g scale, and avoid stacking redoses. Thermoregulation: entactogenic stimulants can cause hyperthermia, hyponatraemia, and rhabdomyolysis under exertion or hot environments—plan cooling breaks, avoid overhydration, and include electrolytes. Route risks: avoid injection—synthetic cathinone injecting is linked to severe local/systemic harms and compulsive use. Nasal use is irritating and can damage mucosa; oral or carefully prepared rectal solutions are less caustic. Tolerance and spacing: tolerance rises quickly after a strong session; waiting 10–14 days is a prudent spacing interval to reduce neurochemical stress. Comedown care: nutrition, sleep, hydration with electrolytes, and avoiding depressant ‘knockouts’ reduce rebound anxiety and cardiovascular strain.",

This underexposure pattern drives unnecessary redosing and increases side‑effect variability. QTc prolongation with therapeutic oral dosing is typically in the low‑to‑moderate range on average, but torsades risk rises sharply with QTc ≥500 ms or large within‑person increases (≥60 ms); correct electrolytes and avoid stacking QT‑prolongers. IM ziprasidone is for acute agitation; do not inject IV. The IM product contains SBECD, which is renally cleared; use caution in significant renal impairment. Ziprasidone’s metabolism is predominantly via aldehyde oxidase with a lesser CYP3A4 contribution; thus, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers usually cause only modest level changes compared with drugs cleared mainly by CYPs. Rare but serious DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) has been reported; any fever/rash/systemic symptoms in the first month warrant immediate discontinuation and evaluation. Akathisia and other EPS can occur, particularly at higher doses or when used to counter stimulant effects; paradoxical restlessness may worsen distress even as psychosis is blunted. If considering higher‑than‑label dosing or combining with QT‑prolongers, obtain a recent ECG; QTc ≥500 ms is a stop signal and ≥450–470 ms warrants caution and risk‑factor mitigation.",

    "notes": "Identity and substitution risks are significant: recent European drug checking warns that potent pyrrolidinophenones like α‑PVP are frequently mis-sold as other cathinones; test samples and start with an allergy dose to mitigate overdose from mislabeling. Weak or absent reactions on common reagent tests are reported for some pyrrolidinophenones; use multi-reagent panels and, when available, TLC or GC/MS-based services to confirm identity. Compulsive redosing is a major risk driver with this class; pre‑portion doses, set a hard session cap, and secure remaining material to reduce binges. Hyperthermia and dehydration contribute to complications with stimulants; take regular cool‑down breaks, avoid vigorous exertion in hot settings, and sip small amounts of water or isotonic fluids (not more than roughly 500 mL per hour) to avoid both dehydration and overhydration. Nasal use commonly causes irritation and sores; using fine powders, spacing lines, and saline rinses post‑session can reduce harm. Vaporizing/freebasing can be especially harsh on the airway and has been linked to chest tightness and lung discomfort; keep temperatures low, avoid long inhalations, and consider safer ROAs. Intravenous use markedly increases acute risk (vein irritation, infections, intense cravings); if people inject despite risks, use new sterile equipment every injection and never share supplies; strongly consider non‑injecting routes. Sleep loss magnifies anxiety, paranoia, and crash severity; plan for at least one full night of recovery sleep and avoid back‑to‑back stimulant days. Tolerance builds rapidly after heavy sessions and partially recovers over a week; spacing sessions (≥7 days) reduces escalation. Avoid polydrug stacks with other stimulants, tramadol, or bupropion due to seizure risk; if severe agitation, chest pain, or overheating occurs, seek urgent care—benzodiazepines and external cooling are first‑line in clinical settings.",

    "notes": "Pharmacology and potency: MDPV is a very potent reuptake inhibitor at DAT and NET with minimal SERT activity (nM potency), markedly stronger than cocaine by weight; this aligns with intense reinforcement and cardiovascular strain. Doses must be measured with a mg-precision scale or prepared via volumetric dosing; eyeballing crystals is unsafe. Duration is highly dose- and redose-dependent; even small boosters can prolong insomnia and anxiety for many hours. Toxicity profile includes severe agitation, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, renal injury and multiorgan failure in case reports; fatalities and numerous non-fatal intoxications have been recorded by EU monitoring. In emergencies, first-line sedation with benzodiazepines is recommended for stimulant-induced agitation/hyperthermia; clinicians are cautious with pure β-blockers in acute stimulant toxicity due to potential unopposed α-adrenergic effects; mixed α/β blockade may be used in-hospital. Harm reduction: pre-measure single doses; avoid continuous redosing; set a firm session cap; cool environment, rest periods, and moderate fluids with electrolytes (avoid overhydration); avoid high ambient temperatures and strenuous activity. Avoid MAOIs and other stimulants. Nasal use can cause significant irritation/vasoconstriction; vaporizing freebase carries pulmonary irritation risk and promotes compulsive use. Drug checking: multi-reagent testing reduces misrepresentation risk—MDPV gives orange→brown with Mecke, while MDMA goes dark blue/black; MDPV and other pyrrolidinophenones have been found sold as or in ‘ecstasy’. Post-acute: insomnia, anxiety, and anhedonia may persist 1–2 days or more; prioritize sleep hygiene and avoid sedative overuse.",

    "notes": "Evidence-based harm reduction points: (1) A fatality solely attributed to 4‑fluoro‑3‑methyl‑α‑PVP was reported with femoral blood 26 ng/mL; this illustrates that severe cardiotoxicity and lethal outcomes may occur at low nanogram-per-millilitre blood concentrations, so conservative dosing and strict avoidance of rapid redosing are essential. (2) Clinical presentations of pyrovalerone-type intoxication commonly include agitation, delirium, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia and, in severe cases, seizures; seek urgent care for chest pain, very high temperature, or severe confusion. (3) Freebasing/smoking produces a very rapid onset and powerful craving but has been anecdotally linked to acute lung injury with pyrovalerones; if chosen despite risks, avoid overheating, plastics, and improvised devices; consider safer ROAs. (4) Combining stimulants with depressants (e.g., alcohol, GHB/GBL, opioids, large benzodiazepine doses) is hazardous because the stimulant can mask sedation, then wear off abruptly, precipitating respiratory depression; if sedation is needed for severe stimulant toxicity, use medically supervised benzodiazepines rather than self-medicating. (5) Tramadol significantly lowers seizure threshold; combining with stimulants adds risk of seizures—avoid this mix. (6) Injection markedly escalates harm with pyros (rapid compulsive use, vascular injury, infectious-disease outbreaks have been associated with α‑PVP injection); avoid injecting; if someone injects anyway, use sterile technique, wheel filters, and new equipment every time. (7) Adulteration/mis-selling is common in the cathinone market (e.g., α‑PVP sold as ‘3‑MMC’); use multi-reagent tests as a first pass and, where possible, confirm with FT‑IR/GC‑MS drug checking; do not rely on appearance, and be aware that FT‑IR can miss low‑level adulterants (<~5%). (8) Set a pre‑committed total dose and time limit for a session and avoid continuous top-ups; ensure hydration with electrolytes, food intake, cooling breaks, and sleep recovery. (9) Intranasal use can damage nasal mucosa over time; alternate nostrils, use fine powders and gentle technique, and allow days for recovery; consider oral dosing if nasal irritation occurs. (10) Expect rapid tolerance after a single heavy session; plan at least 1–2 weeks off to allow tolerance and sleep patterns to normalize.",

    "notes": "Evidence status: there are no published human pharmacokinetic or controlled dosing studies for flmodafinil (NLS‑4) as of November 11, 2025; most practical guidance derives from preclinical work on NLS‑4 and community reports. In mice, NLS‑4 produced robust wake-promotion at lower doses than modafinil and did not show rebound hypersomnia, indicating higher potency but not necessarily a longer duration in humans. Modafinil (the parent scaffold) is an atypical dopamine transporter blocker and can induce/inhibit CYP enzymes with repeated dosing; flmodafinil’s DDI profile in humans is unknown, so it is prudent to assume similar interaction risks, particularly with CYP2C19/3A4 substrates and hormonal contraceptives, if using on sequential days. Very rare but serious dermatologic reactions (SJS/TEN) have been reported with armodafinil/modafinil; any widespread rash, mucosal lesions, fever, or systemic symptoms warrant immediate discontinuation and medical evaluation. Avoid intranasal use: users frequently report chemical irritation and unpleasant drip with little benefit over oral; oral early-morning dosing minimizes insomnia. Stimulant-stacking (other RX stimulants, heavy caffeine) raises cardiovascular/anxiety burden without clear cognitive advantage. Tolerance can build with repeated use; community logs describe marked attenuation after 1–2 weeks of daily/twice‑daily dosing—spacing use (several drug‑free days per week) helps preserve effect. Avoid heating/smoking/vaping powders: modafinil‑class compounds thermally degrade into benzhydryl byproducts under GC‑like temperatures, underscoring unknown pyrolysis products and potential toxicity if smoked. Use an accurate 0.001 g scale; vendor purity varies and mislabeling is possible in unregulated markets.",

    "notes": "Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with additional positive allosteric modulation at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; together these actions raise central acetylcholine and can intensify REM dream vividness, recall, and lucid dreaming probability. The oral Tmax is about 1 hour and terminal half-life ~7 hours; taking it at standard bedtime often misses late-night REM, so oneirogenic protocols typically use a ‘wake-back-to-bed’ dose 4–6 hours after sleep onset to align the peak with REM-rich sleep. Vagotonic effects can cause bradycardia and AV block even in people without known conduction disease; anyone with cardiac conditions or taking rate-slowing drugs should consult a clinician and avoid unsupervised use. Common cholinergic side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, sweating, hypersalivation, dizziness, and appetite/weight loss; taking with food and adequate fluids and titrating slowly can reduce GI effects. Galantamine increases gastric acid secretion; individuals with active peptic ulcer disease or using gastric-irritant NSAIDs should be cautious and consider gastroprotection. Cholinesterase inhibitors can prolong the effect of succinylcholine and similar neuromuscular blockers; disclose recent galantamine use to anesthesia providers to prevent prolonged paralysis/apnea. Bronchospasm can occur due to cholinergic activity; people with asthma or COPD should avoid unsupervised use and monitor for wheeze or dyspnea. Rare but serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens–Johnson syndrome) have been reported; stop immediately and seek care if rash or mucosal lesions appear. Urinary outflow obstruction may worsen due to increased detrusor activity; those with BPH or urinary retention should be cautious. Combining with other cholinergics (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine, huperzine A, large choline donors) increases cholinergic adverse effects; avoid stacking. Strong CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, ketoconazole, erythromycin) can raise levels and side effects; inducers (rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) may reduce effectiveness. Seizures have been reported; people with seizure disorders should consult a clinician and avoid sleep deprivation or concurrent pro-convulsant substances. For lucid dreamers, space doses by several days and avoid frequent redosing to limit side effects and reduce anecdotal tolerance; pharmacologic tolerance is not well characterized. Keep single doses modest (e.g., 4–8 mg WBTB) and avoid combining with sedating antihistamines or alcohol, which can disturb sleep architecture and mask adverse symptoms.",

    "notes": "• Identity and synonyms: Flubrotizolam is a thienotriazolodiazepine; synonyms reported in chemical databases include Flurotizolam and research code LS‑152,574. This helps avoid confusion with similarly named benzodiazepines when checking results or labels.\n• Potency: Active doses are typically in the sub‑milligram range; inaccurate measurement greatly increases risks of amnesia, injury, and respiratory depression. Volumetric dosing is recommended for solutions or powders to achieve microgram‑level accuracy.\n• Onset and duration: Oral onset can be delayed up to 45–60 minutes with peaks at 1–3 hours; this lag increases the risk of impatient redosing and subsequent blackout. Plan doses with the delayed onset in mind.\n• Next‑day sedation: Numerous user reports describe marked next‑day impairment and sedation; avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least 24 hours after significant dosing.\n• Tolerance and dependence: Tolerance can escalate quickly with daily or binge use; spacing doses and avoiding consecutive‑day use lowers risk of rapid tolerance and severe withdrawal.\n• Interactions: Combining with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, GHB/GBL, barbiturates, Z‑drugs, gabapentinoids) can cause unpredictable synergy leading to loss of consciousness and life‑threatening respiratory depression. Avoid polydrug depressant use.\n• Mislabeling/adulteration: RC “Xanax” or “FANAX” style bars and benzo solutions may contain unexpected actives or stimulant admixtures; use reputable drug‑checking services where available and do not assume branding reflects contents.\n• Overdose management: Primary treatment is supportive airway and breathing management; flumazenil can precipitate seizures or acute withdrawal in benzodiazepine‑tolerant individuals or mixed overdoses and should only be used by clinicians under appropriate indications.\n• Route of administration: Non‑oral routes (e.g., injection, inhalation) increase harm without proven benefit; sublingual/oral routes are preferred if one chooses to use.\n• Memory effects: Anterograde amnesia and “false sobriety” are common; pre‑plan environment, remove hazards, and avoid important tasks or conflict‑prone situations when under the influence.\n• Product variability: Different vendors and batches vary in concentration and excipients; start with very small test doses from a new batch, even if experienced.\n• Legal status and availability can change; possession may carry legal risk. Always verify current local regulations before obtaining or transporting substances.",

Sub-milligram accuracy is essential—use volumetric dosing (e.g., 1 mg in 10 mL 50:50 ethanol:water or PG/ethanol) measured with a marked oral syringe; do not rely on drop counts due to large variability. Most benzodiazepines are poorly water-soluble and perform unpredictably intranasally; oral or sublingual routes are safer and more consistent. New benzodiazepines are frequently mis-sold or adulterated; counterfeit 'benzo' tablets and liquids have been found to contain bromazolam, stimulants, and even nitazene opioids—use an accredited drug checking service where available. Combining with opioids or other depressants is the primary cause of fatal outcomes; avoid co-use, and ensure naloxone and oxygen access if opioids are present. Short-acting, high-potency benzos increase blackout and 'delusions of sobriety'; set a hard cap (≤0.5 mg per 12 h) and avoid daily use. Expect rebound insomnia/anxiety as effects wear off; spacing uses by weeks reduces tolerance and withdrawal risk. Standard immunoassay urine tests target oxazepam-like metabolites and may miss some designer benzos; specialized confirmatory testing is needed. Avoid driving or hazardous tasks for at least 8–12 h after the last dose, longer if drowsy.",

Test unknown pills/powders where available. • Counterfeit “Xanax/Valium” frequently contain non‑prescribed benzos with unpredictable doses; obtain only from legitimate medical channels or use lab drug‑checking services where legal. • Tolerance and physical dependence can develop quickly; abrupt cessation after repeated use risks severe withdrawal and seizures. Any reduction after regular use should be gradual under medical guidance (commonly via substitution with a longer‑acting benzodiazepine and slow taper). • Flumazenil can precipitate seizures or acute withdrawal in dependent users and is not routinely recommended in mixed‑overdose; emergency care is largely supportive. Users and bystanders should call emergency services rather than seeking flumazenil outside clinical settings. • Marked anterograde amnesia and “delusions of sobriety” increase redose risk; pre‑plan dose limits, log times, and avoid stacking doses. Community HR resources explicitly advise against redosing in benzo use. • Psychomotor impairment (slowed reaction time, ataxia, slurred speech) can persist after perceived offset; avoid driving or hazardous tasks until fully alert, often 24+ hours. • Non‑oral routes (e.g., injecting/insufflating powders of unknown composition) add risks from insoluble binders and dose dumping; oral/sublingual routes with accurate measurement are safer. General HR guidance emphasizes test first, start low, and avoid using alone. • The unregulated market is volatile; if you choose to proceed, consider professional drug‑checking and carry naloxone when opioids might be present (naloxone reverses opioids, not benzos, but can still save lives in co‑exposures). Population‑level services report frequent co‑occurrence. ",

    "notes": "Harm-reduction points and cautions: 1) First-generation antihistamines have central anticholinergic effects; high doses can cause confusion, agitation, hallucinations, urinary retention, blurred vision, tachycardia, and potentially dangerous hyperthermia. Seek urgent care for severe agitation, delirium, hot/dry skin, or urinary retention. 2) Chlorpheniramine has a long elimination half-life (about 21–27 hours), so next-day drowsiness, slowed reaction time, and impaired coordination may persist beyond the 4–6 hour symptom-relief window; avoid driving or operating machinery if sedated. 3) Do not combine with dextromethorphan-containing ‘CCC/Triple C’ products: chlorpheniramine inhibits the serotonin transporter and is a CYP2D6 inhibitor/substrate; with DXM (a serotonergic CYP2D6 substrate), this raises the risk of serotonin syndrome and delirium. 4) Avoid co-use with MAOIs (or within 14 days of stopping one) due to severe interaction risk, especially if any serotonergic medicine (including DXM) is also present. 5) Additive CNS and respiratory depression occur with alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other sedatives; if accidental co-use occurs, keep doses low, avoid re-dosing, and ensure a sober monitor. 6) In hot environments or exertion (festivals, clubs), anticholinergic reduction of sweating increases overheating risk; hydrate, rest in shade, and stop use if feeling hot, confused, or unwell. 7) Older adults and those with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy/BPH, or a history of urinary retention are more sensitive to anticholinergic effects; consider non-sedating antihistamines instead and consult a clinician. 8) Overdose management is medical: there is no at-home antidote; in hospital, physostigmine may be considered for severe anticholinergic delirium by trained clinicians. 9) Product labels differ; many multi-symptom cold remedies already include chlorpheniramine—avoid double-dosing by checking ‘active ingredients’ on all concurrent OTCs. 10) Clinically significant hepatotoxicity is rare with chlorpheniramine-class drugs, but report unexplained jaundice, dark urine, or right-upper-quadrant pain if they occur after repeated dosing.",
